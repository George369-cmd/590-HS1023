“it is horribly sad, especially when one remembers what i heard this morning, hamilton. the girl mr. onslow went wild about six years ago is out in florida this minute, and free. duvernay, the man she married, died six months ago of malarial fever. you know mr. onslow was engaged to her just after he left cambridge and went as an _attaché_, and was desperately fond of her, as i imagined he could be; and when her people forced her into marrying the other fellow, he threw up his post and wandered into all the most out-of-the-way corners of the earth to try and forget things. what makes me so interested is this: i’ve just found out that she was a miss mabel kildare before she was married, and when i was a child i used to know her sister elsie very well indeed. in fact, i believe we were some sort of cousins, and for half a year we had the same governess together, and were as intimate as two children could be. then her sister married mr. duvernay, who had a colonial appointment, and elsie went with them abroad, and we dropped completely out of touch with one another. strange, isn’t it, that i should hear of her again the same day that brings news of poor mr. onslow’s death?”
