“i am not disguising from myself the fact that amy is an heiress. at the same time, i am not altogether a pauper myself. but i don’t think we two need go into that part of the money question, mr. shelf. as a point of fact (as you know quite well), she and i first met one another abroad, and fell in love, and got engaged without knowing a single word about our mutual outlook, social or financial. the point here is that amy wants to become part purchaser in this kent property with myself, and on her behalf i come to you for the formal permission. you know by the terms of her father’s will she was to have all her wishes with regard to the property taken into consideration after she reached the age of twenty-one, but was still to be under the semi-guidance of the trustees till she reached her twenty-third birthday.”
