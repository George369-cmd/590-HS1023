on the night of the day that the brothers steamship company was floated she had arranged a dinner-table at her house which is destined to live down through time. there was a great cabinet minister present, who, as the chief guest, took her down to dinner; and there was also in the room the ambassador from one of the greater continental courts, with whom the minister had, after dinner, ten minutes of quiet, informal talk in the corner of the drawing-room. that talk laid the groundwork of a certain international agreement, afterwards elaborated, which has never yet been made public. but some day it will be sprung upon europe with a crash, and a whirlwind of wonder; and then the papers will refer to mrs. theodore shelfâ€™s dinner-table as a manufactory of history.
