“sor, wake or ye’ll be sunstrook, if ye’re not that already. rouse, sor; i can’t lug ye below, an’ i can’t rig an awnin’. i’m too tired to spake again; but if yez stay here ye’ll fry like a rasher an’ be ate by flies. there’s a whopping skeeter in each of yer eyeholes this minut, an’ a kind of a locust browsing on the end of yer snout. listen! i’m knockin’ wid a boot-toe on yer ribs. well, man, now, if ye won’t listen to reason, it’s just leavin’ yez i am to stew in yer own juice.”
