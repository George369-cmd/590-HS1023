“i’m afraid, practically so. the two lifeboats were picked up next morning, and their crews taken into mobile. when they came to count heads it was found that the captain and onslow and one of the engine-room hands were missing. in the hurry of the escape they seem to have got into neither lifeboat. the telegram says that no other boat would have lived a minute in the sea that was running at the time, even if one had been lowered. and the mate, who writes, does not think that this was even attempted, because the _port edes_ sank before the two lifeboats had driven out of sight. we had a private cablegram at the office before i left, and that told how other steamers crossing that part of the gulf had been on the look-out, but up to then not even so much as a scrap of wreckage had been sighted. so i fear it is past a doubt that she sank like a stone in deep water, and took those poor fellows down with her.”
