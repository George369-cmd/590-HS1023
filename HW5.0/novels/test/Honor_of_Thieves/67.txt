 mr. theodore shelf was a _gourmand_ of the first water. he preached most violently against all people who drank to excess, and seemed scarcely to discriminate between these and other people who were decorously moderate. he included them all in one sweeping anathema, and rammed home his charges with countless texts always once a sunday, and usually on several weekdays as well. he was a powerful exhorter in his own particular narrow groove, was mr. theodore shelf, and a vast number of people believed in him, and put out their savings to usury under his directions.
