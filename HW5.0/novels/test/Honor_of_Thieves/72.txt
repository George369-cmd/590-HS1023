in social standing george was not a gentleman. nature had intended him for the professional extinction of rats, and given him a preternatural gutter cleverness. fate had him surrounded with affluence and regular meals. the pursuit of rats was forbidden him; battles with canine acquaintances were discouraged; and his one dissipation was sneaking away from his residence and making love to the barmaid in an adjacent public-house in return for biscuits and sugar. as a general result he waxed portly, and could look upon most kinds of rascality with a lenient eye, and perfectly understood why mr. shelfâ€™s private brandy-bottle lodged in retirement from the public view.
