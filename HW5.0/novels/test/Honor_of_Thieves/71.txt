it has been stated that mr. theodore shelf was a man entirely wanting the saving salt of humor. but this i think is wrong. when he was alone he would take george on his knee, and whisper in that small animal’s ear, and call up a sardonic expression amongst the smug, sanctimonious lines of his face that was not carried there in outer life. at times, too, he would even laugh—a new, gleeful laugh; far different from the saintly reproving smile which was the only sign of mirth that ever illuminated his features before a more talkative confidant. but then george was taciturn; he could express whole pages by one quick pucker of the nose and half a tail-wag; and he was never known to gossip. perhaps it was because he made such a prodigiously safe confidant that mr. theodore shelf was so fond of george.
