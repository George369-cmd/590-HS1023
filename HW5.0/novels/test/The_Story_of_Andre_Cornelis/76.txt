it was he who was giving orders now, he who was threatening. how plainly had he read my mind, to stand up before me in such an attitude. furious passion broke loose in me; i took in the facts of the situation. this man had loved my mother madly enough to purchase her at the cost of the murder of his most intimate friend, and he loved her after all those years passionately enough to desire that not one of the days he had still to pass with her might be lost to him. and it was also true that never, never should i have the courage to reveal the terrific truth to the poor woman. i was suddenly carried away by rage to the point of losing all control over my frenzy. "ah!" i cried, "since you will not do justice on yourself, die then, at once!" i stretched out my hand and seized the dagger which he had recently placed upon the table. he looked at me without flinching, or recoiling, indeed presenting his breast to me, as though to brave my childish rage. i was on his left, bending down, and ready to spring. i saw his smile of contempt, and then with all my strength i struck him with the knife in the direction of the heart. the blade entered his body to the hilt. no sooner had i done this thing than i recoiled, wild with terror at the deed. he uttered a cry. his face was distorted with terrible agony, and he moved his right hand towards the wound, as though he would draw out the dagger. he looked at me, convulsed with unbearable agony; i saw that he wanted to speak; his lips moved, but no sound issued from his mouth. the expression of a supreme effort passed into his eyes, he turned to the table, took a pen, dipped it into the inkstand, and traced two lines on a sheet of paper within his reach. he looked at me again, his lips moved once more, then he fell down like a log.
