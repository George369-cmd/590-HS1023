i began to read them in the cab on my way to the avenue montaigne. the first, which was of great length, reminded edmond of his past faults and the hopelessness of his actual condition, and then indicated, without entering into any particulars, a possible means of at least partially repairing all these disasters and once more gaining a fortune. the first condition was that the outlaw should scrupulously obey the orders of his brother. he was to begin by announcing his departure from new york to all his ordinary associates, and then to remove into another quarter of the city under a new name, and wait there for the next letter. that one, the second, made it evident that an answer from edmond had been received prior to its despatch, and that he had accepted the offer. by this second letter the wretch was enjoined to go to liverpool and to await further instructions there. these instructions, contained in the third letter--a mere note--were limited to an appointment at an early date, at ten o'clock in the evening, in paris, on the portion of the footpath of the rue de jussieu which faces the rue guy-de-la-brosse. at that hour, those two streets, situated between the old jardin des plantes and the buildings of the entrep√¥t des vins, are as solitary as the streets of a country town. there was no more mention in this note than in the two preceding letters of the plan that had been laid by jacques termonde, and which was to be discussed by the brothers at their first meeting after so many years; but, even if i had not had the false rochdale's own avowal, extorted by his surprise and terror, the coincidence of date between this clandestine recall and the assassination of my father constituted an undeniable proof. i read and re-read those accusing pages--as i had read and re-read my father's letters written at the same time--first in the cab, and then in the solitude of my own apartment, and the horrible plot which had made me fatherless was fully revealed to me with all its terrible details.
