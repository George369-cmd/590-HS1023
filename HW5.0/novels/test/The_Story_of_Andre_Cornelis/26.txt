"you shall pay for this!" he cried; and at the same instant, when he was no longer covered by my pistol, he pushed the table upon me so violently, that if i had not sprung backwards i must have been thrown down; but he already had time to fling himself upon me and seize me round the body. happily for me the violence of the attack had knocked the pistol out of my hands, so that i could not be tempted to use it, and a struggle began between us in which not one word was spoken by either. with his first rush he had flung me to the ground; but i was strong, and the strange premonitions of danger, from which i suffered in my youth, had led me to develop all my physical energy and adroitness. i felt his breath on my face, his skin upon my skin, his muscles striving against mine, and at the same time the dread that our conflict might be overheard gave me the coolness which he had lost. after a few minutes of this tussle, and just as his strength was failing, he fastened his teeth in my shoulder so savagely that the pain of the bite maddened me; i wrenched one of my arms from his grasp and seized him by the throat at the risk of choking him. i held him under me now, and i struck his head against the floor as though i meant to smash it. he remained motionless for a minute, and i thought i had killed him. i first picked up my pistol, which had rolled away to the door, and then bathed his forehead with water in order to revive him.
