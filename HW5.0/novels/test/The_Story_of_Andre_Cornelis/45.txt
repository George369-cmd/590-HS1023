then, with a threatening gesture, i quitted the room, leaving him seated at the table near the window. i had hardly reached the corridor when my nerves, which had been so strangely under my control during the struggle, failed me. my legs bent under me, and i feared i was about to fall. how was i to account for the disorder of my clothes? i made a great effort, concealed the torn ends of my cravat, turned up the collar of my coat to hide the condition of my shirt, and did my best to repair the damage that had been done to my hat. i then wiped my face with my handkerchief, and went downstairs with a slow and careless step. the inspector of the first floor was, doubtless, occupied at the other end of the corridor; but two of the waiters saw me and were evidently surprised at my aspect. they were, however, too busy, luckily for me, to stop me and inquire into the cause of my discomposure. at last i reached the courtyard. if anybody who knew me had been there? i got into the first cab and gave my address. i had kept my word. i had conquered.
