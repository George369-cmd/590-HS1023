"listen to me," said i, now assuming a tone of extreme contempt. "the powerful motive which i have for not shooting you like a mad dog, you shall learn. i do not choose that my mother should ever know what a man she married in your brother. do you now understand why i resolved to let you go; provided you are of the same mind, however; for even the idea of my mother would not stop me, if you pushed me too far. i will add, for your guidance, that the limitation by which you supposed yourself to be safe from pursuit for the murder in 1864 has been traversed; you are therefore staking your head at this moment. for ten years past you have been successfully levying blackmail on your brother. i do not suppose you have merely played upon the chord of fraternal love. when you came from america to assume the personality of rochdale, it was clearly necessary that he should send you some instructions. you have kept those letters. i offer you one hundred thousand francs for them."
