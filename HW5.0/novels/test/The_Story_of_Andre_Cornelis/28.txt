"there is still time," i said. "i give you five minutes to decide upon the bargain which i proposed to you just now; the letters, and one hundred thousand francs, with your liberty; if not, a bullet in your head. choose. i wished to spare you on account of my mother; but i will not lose my vengeance both ways. i shall be arrested, your papers will be searched, the letters will be found, it will be known that i had a right to shoot you. my mother will go mad with grief; but i shall be avenged. i have spoken. you have five minutes, not one more."
