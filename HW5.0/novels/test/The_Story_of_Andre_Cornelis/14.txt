fury had seized upon him; he was about to shout "help!" and the worst of it was that rage was rising in me also. it was he, with that same hand which i saw creeping along the table, strong, hairy, seeking something to throw at me--yes--it was he who had killed my father. one impulse more of anger and i was lost; a bullet was lodged in his body, and i saw his blood flow. oh, what good it would have done me to see that sight! but no, i had made the sacrifice of this particular vengeance. in a second, i beheld myself arrested, obliged to explain everything, and my mother exposed to all the misery of it. happily for me, he also had an interval of reflection. the first idea that must have occurred to him was that his brother had betrayed him, by telling me one-half of the truth, so as to deliver him up to my vengeance. the second, no doubt, was that, for a son who came to avenge his dead father, i was making a good deal of delay about it. there was a momentary silence between us. this allowed me to regain my coolness, and to say: "you are mistaken," so quietly that his amazement was visible in his face. he looked at me, then closed his eyes, and knitted his brow. i felt that he could not endure my resemblance to my father.
