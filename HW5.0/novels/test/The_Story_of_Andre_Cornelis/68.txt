"be silent, you--" said i still more fiercely. "is it to me that you dare to speak thus--to me? did i need those letters in order to learn all? have we not known for weeks past, i, that you had committed the crime, and you, that i had divined your guilt? what i still needed was the written, indisputable, undeniable proof, that which can be laid before a magistrate. you refused him money? you were about to give him money, only that you mistrusted him, and chose to wait until the day of his departure. you did not suspect that i was upon your track. shall i tell you when it was you saw him for the last time? yesterday, at ten o'clock in the morning, you went out, you changed your cab first at the place de la concorde, and a second time at the palais royal. you went to the grand hotel, and you asked whether mr. stanbury was in his room. a few hours later, i, i myself, was in that same room. ah! how much did edmond termonde ask from me for the letters? why, i tore them from him, pistol in hand, after a struggle in which i was nearly killed. you see now that you can deceive me no more, and that it is no longer worth your while to deny."
