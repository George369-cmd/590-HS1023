 it was four o'clock in the afternoon on the following day, when i presented myself at the hotel on the boulevard de latour-maubourg. i knew that my mother would most probably be out. i also thought it likely my stepfather would be feeling none the better of his early excursion to the grand hotel on the previous day, and i therefore hoped to find him at home, perhaps in his bed. i was right; my mother was out, and he had remained at home. he was in his study, the room in which our first explanation had taken place. that upon which i was now bent was of far greater importance, and yet i was less agitated than on the former occasion. at last i was completely certain of the facts, and with that certainty a strange calmness had come to me. i can recall my having talked for a few moments with the servant who announced me, about a child of his who was ill. i also remember to have observed for the first time that the smoky chimney of some manufacturing works at the back of the garden, built, no doubt, during the last winter, was visible through the window of the staircase. i record these things because i am bound to recognise that my mind was quite clear and free--for i will be sincere to the end--when i entered the spacious room. my stepfather was reclining in a deep arm-chair at the far side of the fireplace, and occupied in cutting the pages of a new book with a dagger. the blade of this weapon was broad, short, and strong. he had brought the knife back from spain, with several other kinds of arms, which lay about in the rooms he habitually occupied. i now understood the order of ideas which this singular taste indicated. he was dressed for walking; but his altered looks bore witness to the intensity of the crisis through which he had passed. it had affected his whole being. very likely my face was expressive of an extraordinary resolution, for i saw by his eyes as our looks met, that he had read the depths of my thoughts at a glance. nevertheless, he said: "ah, is it you, andr√©? it is very kind of you to come," thus exhibiting once more the power of his self-control, and he put out his hand. i did not take it, and my refusal, contrasting with his gesture of welcome, the silence which i kept for some minutes, the contraction of my features, and, no doubt, the menace in my eyes, entirely enlightened him as to the mood in which i came to him. very quietly, he laid down his book and the spanish knife he had been using, on a large table within his reach, and then he rose from his chair, leaned his back against the mantelpiece, and crossing his arms, looked at me with the haughty stare i knew so well, and which had so often humiliated me in my boyhood. i was the first to break the silence; replying to his polite greeting in a harsh tone, and looking him straight in the face, i said:
