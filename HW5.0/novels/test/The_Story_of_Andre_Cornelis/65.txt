"the cowardly assassin," i continued, "yes, the coward, because he dared not commit the crime himself, had carefully calculated all the circumstances of the murder; but he had reckoned without certain little accidents, for instance, that his brother would keep the three letters he had received, the first two at new york, the last at liverpool, and which contained instructions relating to the stages of this clandestine journey. neither had he taken into account that the son of his victim would grow up, would become a man, would conceive certain suspicions of the true cause of his father's death, and would succeed in procuring overwhelming proof of the dark conspiracy. come, then," i added fiercely, "off with the mask! m. jacques termonde, it is you who had my unhappy father killed by your brother edmond. i have in my possession the letters you wrote him in january, 1864, to induce him to come to europe, first under the false name of rochester and afterwards under that of rochdale. it is not worth your while to play the indignant or the astonished with me--the game is up."
