"no," he cried, "no, andré, not yet! pity me, andré, pity me! see now, i am a condemned man, i have not six months to live. your revenge! ah! you had no need to undertake it. what! if i have done a terrible deed, do you think i have not been punished for it? look at me, only look at me; i am dying of this frightful secret. it is all over; my days are numbered. the few that remain, leave, oh leave them to me! understand this, i am not afraid to die; but to kill myself, to go away, leaving this grief to her whom you love as i do! it is true that, to win her, i have done an atrocious deed; but say, answer, has there ever been an hour, a minute since, in which her happiness was not my only aim? and you would have me leave her thus, inflict upon her the torment of thinking that while i might have grown old by her side, i preferred to go away, to forsake her before the time? no, andré, this last year, leave it to me! ah, leave it to me, leave it to us, for i assure you that i am hopelessly ill, that i know it, that the doctors have not hidden it from me. in a few months--fix a date--if the disease has not carried me off, you can come back. but i shall be dead. she will weep for me, without the horror of that idea that i have forestalled my hour, she who is so pious! you only will be there to console her, to love her. have pity upon her, if not upon me. see, i have no more pride towards you, i entreat you in her name, in the name of her dear heart, for well you know its tenderness. you love her, i know that; i have guessed truly that you hid your suspicions to spare her pain. i tell you once again, my life is a hell, and i would joyfully give it to you in expiation of what i have done; but she, andré, she, your mother, who has never, never cherished a thought that was not pure and noble, no, do not inflict this torture upon her."
