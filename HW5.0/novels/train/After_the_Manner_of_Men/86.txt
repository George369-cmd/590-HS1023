“the c. c. & i. company, which is another name in this part o’ the warld for consolidated coal--the trust. the combine owns all the producing mines hereabouts; they’ve got one in full blast at whitlow, five miles above this. if you should develop into anything worth while, it would be another case of the lion and the lamb lying down in peace together--with the ocoee lamb inside of the trust lion. they couldn’t afford to lat ye operate. your coke, for as much of it as ye could make, would drive theirs out o’ the market.”
