but was carfax really in love with judge birrell’s daughter? tregarvon boasted that he had summered and wintered the golden youth; yet there were depths in him that the philadelphian suspected no one had ever fully plumbed. in tregarvon’s knowing of him he had always been, or appeared to be, immune to sentiment; his attitude had been that of a gentle-natured soul who was willing to be used, or even abused, without detriment to an impartial affection for the entire sex. would such a man be able to make richardia as happy as she deserved to be? in the intimacy which tregarvon had pressed to its ultimate limits he had come to know that behind the cool, slate-blue eyes and the lips that lent themselves so readily to playful mockery there was a passionate soul which would give all and demand all; which would starve on a diet of mere affection, however kindly and indulgent. would the carfax millions outweigh this demand? it was an irritating question, refusing to be answered.
