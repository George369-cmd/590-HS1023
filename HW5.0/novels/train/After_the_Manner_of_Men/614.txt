it was while carfax was lowering himself with more care than tregarvon had taken, with the leaning tree to help, that he made a small discovery and called tregarvon back. on its outer or valley-facing side the leaning tree carried a “blazed” scar with markings similar to those on the white-oak half-way between the cliff and the glade. like the other scar, this one was old, and the bark had long since healed around the edges of the ax-wound. but the markings, which were cut into the heart-wood, were still quite distinct.
