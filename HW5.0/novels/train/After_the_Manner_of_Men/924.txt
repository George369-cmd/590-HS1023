tregarvon saw at once that the ocoee experiment was made vastly less hopeful by the discovery to which richardia had led him. though he had never met judge birrell, coalville gossip had done the fiery old recluse ample justice. for the loungers at tait’s store the judge figured as a venerable survival of the _ancien régime_; of the good old times when the great landed proprietors ruled their small kingdoms with an iron rod; and were coincidentally and in the meliorating sense of the word, kindly and generous tyrants to all and sundry. tregarvon had heard enough to assure him that the sentiment of the entire countryside would be with judge birrell in any cause he might see fit to champion; but apart from this, the one insurmountable bar to any defensive reprisals on his own part lay in richardia’s appeal. tregarvon felt that the appeal, and his yielding thereto, had effectually tied his hands, and he was still sufficiently infatuated to be glad. carfax might marry richardia and endow her with his millions; but her greatest debt would still be to the man who had refused to defend himself at her father’s expense.
