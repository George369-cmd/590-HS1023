“the mcnabbs are just a whiskey-making lot of poor bodies living back in the pocket beyond highmount. an unscrupulous lawyer-scamp got hold of them when the second ocoee company was fair rolling in money, and showed them how they could trump up a claim to a wedge-like slip o’ land on the top o’ the mountain which, if the claim could be made good, would cut off the mine a hundred feet or so back from the cliff. there was neither sense nor justice in it, and the courts said so. ye’ll be having no trouble wi’ the mcnabbs, unless one o’ them might be taking a pop at ye wi’ his squirrel-gun some fine day.”
