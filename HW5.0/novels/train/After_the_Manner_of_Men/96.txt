“i have been told, captain duncan, that you have made an analysis of the ocoee coals. also, i have been given to understand that no two veins in these tennessee coal-measures have exactly the same characteristics; that the quality of the coal varies with its distance from the original surface, though the depth difference between any two deposits may be very slight. if you didn’t know of the existence of the six-foot layer of stone lying between my two coal seams, would you, or would you not, say that they were one and the same?”
