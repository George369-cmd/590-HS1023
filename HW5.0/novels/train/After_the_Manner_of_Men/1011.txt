“i’m a beast, a cad, the cheapest of cheap skates, poictiers!--anything you like to call me. it hasn’t touched richardia, but it has gone all sorts of despicable distances with me. when you told me the other night that you had proposed to her, i could have murdered you. and just now, when i saw her walking arm in arm with hartridge, i wanted to run amuck and destroy him. i’m not trying to excuse myself when i say that i didn’t go down without a struggle. i did make some kind of a fight at first: i even went so far as to tell richardia all about elizabeth. but it didn’t do any good.”
