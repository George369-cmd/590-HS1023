“uncle byrd’s colorado millions?--yes. and i am rather sorry; for elizabeth’s sake, not less than for my own. we were engaged before uncle byrd died, and he knew it. it was entirely unnecessary--not to say cruel--for him to leave his fortune to elizabeth on the condition that she shouldn’t change her mind and marry somebody else, and to me in case she did.”
