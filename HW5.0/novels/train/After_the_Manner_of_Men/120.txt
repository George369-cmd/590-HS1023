the men came; some from the half-tilled valley farms, a few from the c. c. & i. mines farther up the railroad, and two or three mountaineers. two of the mountain dwellers, long-haired, unshaven backwoodsmen, gave their names as morgan and sill, suppressing, for some reason best known to themselves, their surname of mcnabb. also there came the lean, bristly-bearded man who had squatted behind the althea bushes at the corner of the office-building during tregarvon’s talk with captain duncan; james sawyer, by name. tregarvon knew nothing of this man’s antecedents; of the forehistory of any of them, for that matter. what he demanded was work, and he went about securing it in the best of all possible ways: by stripping off his coat and acting as his own foreman.
