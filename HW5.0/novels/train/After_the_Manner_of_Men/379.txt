“i think it took the able mr. parker all of four months, or possibly a little longer, to squeeze the local stockholders--the only investors who had contributed any real values--out of his scheme; after which he sold the reorganized ocoee to a new england syndicate. the yankees--pardon me; the word is no longer a term of reproach with us--the yankees meant honestly by the ocoee; though, of course, they were under no obligation to recognize the frozen-out natives. they spent money liberally in development and on a costly equipment. but it proved to be a bad investment for them--as it had for the natives.”
