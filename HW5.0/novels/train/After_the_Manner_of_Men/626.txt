the programme was carried out in due course. by ten oâ€™clock they were back on the mountain top with the surveying instruments. placing the transit upon the tripod marks under the tree on the edge of the glade, tregarvon took a forward sight to the eastward, with carfax holding the target-staff on the spot where the burnt torch was found. then, without changing the position of the instrument, tregarvon signalled carfax to go back, halting him at the cliff edge, and moving him to right and left until the target was once more in line with the cross-hairs of the telescope.
