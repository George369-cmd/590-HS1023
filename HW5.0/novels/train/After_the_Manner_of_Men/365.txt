carfax, too, had apparently changed his mind overnight. instead of driving off up the mountain after breakfast, he headed the yellow car down the valley road and was gone all day. when he returned, late in the afternoon, it was evident that he had discovered some other way of ascending pisgah. the committee of leisure, sitting, as usual, on tait’s porch, and amusing itself, also as usual, at the expense of an expatriated london serving-man, marked the yellow car returning by way of the mountain pike; observed, further, that carfax was accompanied by two men, one of whom sprang from the car at the turn in the road nearest to the railway and ran to catch a northbound train of coal-empties, so escaping unidentified by the idlers. carfax’s other passenger, well-known to coalville as “the bug professor” at highmount, descended from the auto more deliberately and went across to the coke-ovens to shake hands with tregarvon.
