“just as were rolling up to pass the stone-pillared lodge-gates a horse and buggy came out, with a young woman driving. the horse was old and countrified, and he didn’t take kindly to the auto. so i stopped and got out to lead him past the machine. you won’t want to believe it, but the young woman driver was miss richardia; and the horse--well, no horseman would call it white, to be sure. it was a dapple-gray, light enough to pass for white in the moonlight, and with a mechanician like rucker for the color expert.”
