“yes. it broke my heart, richardia--which shows you how far i had gone on the road to depravity. poictiers said to me once that i was playing the dog in the manger, and so i was. there was no excuse, of course; there never is an excuse for dishonor. but you were heart and soul and conscience to me, and i seemed to need you so much more than anybody else ever could. i can say all this without blame now, can’t i? you are going to marry poictiers, and i am going to marry elizabeth.”
