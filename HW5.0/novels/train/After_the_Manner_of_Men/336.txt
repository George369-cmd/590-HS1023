this drawing of daddy layne on the drive to whitlow, and, later, an interview with connolly, a hard-mouthed irishman whose crass brutality apparently justified layne’s descriptive epithet of “the man-killer,” gave carfax a clue which he followed patiently until it was time to take layne back to coalville; a clue which led to a scraped acquaintance with the local leaders of the amalgamated mine workers, to affable and seemingly pointless talks with all who dared to talk, and finally to a friendly conference with the miner dockery, layne’s son-in-law.
