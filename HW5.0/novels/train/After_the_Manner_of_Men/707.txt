“my father was one of the sorriest of the losers in the ocoee in the promoting period,” she began soberly. “this entire mountain top was once a part of the birrell estate; my grandfather gave the site for this school. when mr. parker was promoting the ocoee, father went into the plan, heart and soul, giving a large part of the land, and putting all the money he could rake and scrape into the stock of mr. parker’s company. worse than that, he was so firmly convinced of the future success of the undertaking that he persuaded his friends to invest. you mustn’t expect us to be very enthusiastic now, mr. carfax. it isn’t in human nature to rejoice when others are preparing to reap where we have sown.”
