“i can’t joke about it, poictiers. i have made the one crowning blunder that spoils a man’s life. don’t look at me that way. i’m not going to be either a fool or a scoundrel. i shall marry elizabeth and try to make her as happy as i can; but it will be without prejudice to the fact that i didn’t know what love was when i promised her. i can imagine just how brutal that sounds to you, but it’s the truth.”
