“then one day, out of a clear sky, _zip!_ comes uncle byrd with his will and his millions. after which, of course, elizabeth can’t throw me over without impoverishing herself; and it is equally out of the question for me to let her do it. moreover, it is imperatively up to me to make good before i marry her. if i don’t, uncharitable people will say that i let go of the business end of things because i knew that my wife’s money would stop all the holes to keep the wind away. there you have it--sermon length.”
