“i hunted him up this morning; drove down to the cardiff mine for that purpose. they told me yesterday at whitlow that he was at the cardiff. i found him, and we foregathered on the spot. he is having some labor troubles, and was about to drive over the mountain to the swiss settlement at new basel to see if he couldn’t pick up a little new blood. i didn’t have to persuade very hard to get him to abandon his horse and buckboard, and i drove him over and back.”
