“yes; i saw them at work once at axim, on a tramp steamer you sent down there. they were taking krooboys on board. the skipper received them on one of the bridge-deck ladders with a knuckleduster, and kicked ’em along. the chief stood by with a monkey-wrench and tickled them with that as they passed down to the lower deck aft. they mentioned at the time that this process had a fine christianizing influence; prevented the boys from being uppish; showed ’em what the white man could do when he liked; taught ’em humility, in fact. i say, there’s a pull towards this bottom pocket. people have been sitting on the table.”
