“not a bit. byron wrote about piracy, but byron was no seaman, and he didn’t know what hazing a crew meant. a thief’s a dirty scoundrel all the world over, and always has been; and a sea thief, having the scum of the earth to handle, has to make himself the crudest brute on earth if he wants to succeed. i think it’s that which put me out of liking with byron and all those poets who’ve written about movement at sea. they give a wrong idea of men’s motives and actions, and when they get talking on shop, they’re that inaccurate and absurd they make one tired. no, mr. onslow, give me a land poet, who talks about farms, and primroses, and tinkling brooks, and things he understands, and with that man i can sit through two watches on end. reading him may make me feel low, but it doesn’t do a man harm to be that way sometimes. ye see, mr. onslow, a scuffle, or a row with a mutinous crew, is just meat and drink to me. yes, sir, that’s the kind of brute i am.”
