“oh, i quite understand the obligations of bread and salt; but you are beyond the pale of that. you are a noxious beast who ought to be stamped out. still you can be useful to me; so i shall hire myself out to be useful to you. but i have brought these unpleasant facts under your notice, to let you thoroughly understand that i have summed you up from horns to hoofs, and to point out to you that i wouldn’t give a piastre for your most sacred word of honor. we shall be bound to one another in this precious scheme by community of interests alone; and if you can swindle me, you may. only look out for the consequences if you do try it on. i never yet left a score unpaid. we’re _arcades ambo_—rascals both; only we’re different varieties of rascal. i know you pretty thoroughly; and if you don’t know me as well, possibly you will before we’ve done with one another. and now, if it please you, we’ll go into the minuter details of this piece of villainy, and sketch out definitely how we are to steal this half a million in specie, and this valuable steamer, without committing more murder than is absolutely essential to success.”
