“you see, mr. onslow, from my position, so many people look up to me that it is nothing short of my bounden duty to deprive myself of certain things, and be, so far as possible, a humble model for them to form themselves by. long before a constituency sent me to parliament, i devoted my best energies to christianizing the lower classes, and i hope not without success. if appreciation is any criterion, i may say that i was elected president of no less than twelve improvement societies. it took me much time and thought to attend to them. yet i wish i could have given more.”
