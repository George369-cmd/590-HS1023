“is it? well, i don’t know. there have been labor bothers all down through history, and i fancy they’ll continue to the end of time. if you’ll recollect, there was a certain egyptian king who once had troubles with his bricklayers, and i fancy there have been similar difficulties trotting through the centuries in pretty quick succession ever since. of course, each man thinks his own employés the most unreasonable and grasping that have ever uttered opinion since the record began; that’s only natural. but i might point out to you that in definite results you aren’t in the worst box yet. your chariot hasn’t been upset in the red sea so far, and it may be that a certain operation in the mexican gulf will grease up the wheels and set it running on triumphantly. grumble if you like, mr. shelf, but don’t make yourself out to be the worst-used man in history. pharaoh hadn’t half your opportunities.”
