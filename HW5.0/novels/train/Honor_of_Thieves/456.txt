“you’re right, mr. onslow, right all through. by george, i’d half a mind to chip in with these rogues and grab what i could. it was a tempting chance, and it would have been a deal more profitable to me than what i’m in for now. as for the honesty of the thing, there wasn’t a pin to choose between it and this racket of yours and mr. shelf’s. but it was that dutchman’s gall that put me off. if he’d held his silly jaw, and if those other bladder-heads had let me understand i was to hold the pistol-hand over them, well, the _port edes_ would have coral rock spouting through her bottom plates this minute, and i’d be a man owning a matter of three to five thousand pounds. that’s putting it straight.”
