“my dear amy, i never meant to suggest that he was not. there’s no particular secret about his life. he comes of a good west-county family; was a harrow boy, and played in their eleven; went through cambridge; and afterwards found a berth in the diplomatic service. then, by way of variety, he got engaged to be married to a girl who jilted him; on the strength of which he began to run wild. he started on six months’ leave for a trip into tibet, but he stayed beyond the limits of the postal system for two years and a half, and when he got back to england the diplomatic corps found that they could get on very well without him. so he continued his rambles. he doesn’t seem able to settle down.”
