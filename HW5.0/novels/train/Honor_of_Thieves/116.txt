mrs. shelf had, as usual, a concourse of men round her. she was a woman who deliberately cultivated the art of fascination, because it was essential to her ambition; and men are always willing to be dazzled and fascinated. they were laughing when fairfax came up. she saw him from the corner of her eyes, but for the moment took no notice of him. she leaned forward and delivered another sentence to the men before her through the top feathers of her fan, which sent through them another thrill of merriment; and then shut the fan with a click and turned to fairfax.
