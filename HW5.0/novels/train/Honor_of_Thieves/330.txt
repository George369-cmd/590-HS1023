in a canvas chair on the bridge deck under the lee of the fiddley sat patrick onslow, with a pipe between his teeth and pierre loti’s “fantôme d’orient” in his lap. he was distinctly idling. for the moment he was wondering how, from so transparently blue a sea, the spray which jumped from the wave-crests could be colorless and opaque. then, by following with the eye a tangle of yellow gulf weed which floated past, his attention was carried away to some little gray spouts of fog, which told of whales and their calves taking a summer outing in the milk-warm waters of the south. beyond, his eyes fell upon one of the screw-pile lighthouses with which the united states government has fringed the florida shoal; and on the far horizon sprouted the wind-threshed tops of some scattered cabbage palms, which told that there at least the shallow sea was sea no more. at the back of these palms lay the mysterious shelter of the everglades.
