“wait a minute! in confidence i’ll tell you it is on the west coast of florida—on the mexican gulf coast. the interior of southern florida is called the everglades. it’s partly lake, partly swamp; built up of mangroves, saw-grass, cypress trees, and water; tenanted by snakes, alligators, wild beasts, and a few seminole indians. only one expedition of whites has been across it—or rather only one expedition known to history. but i’ve been there, right into the heart of the everglades; in fact, i’ve just come from there; and i netted £1000 out of the trip.”
