“the cowardly dagos,” said kettle; “that’s always their way. snug down to topsails as soon as it gets dark, even if there’s only a cat’s-paw blowing. by james! with a breeze like this i’d be carrying royals on that old tub. and yet,” he went on, with his beard in the heel of his fist, and his eyes gazing out over the tumbling waters—“and yet they say there used to be poetry in a craft of that sort, whilst there never was, and never will be, with a steamer. i suppose the reason is, that a poet has to be a man who knows nothing whatever about what he writes upon. i know that some chaps who string verses nowadays have been on a steamboat and smelt the smells of her, and seen her lines, and watched the men who do the work; and yet they make no poetry about it. but of the old crew who wrote about moaning harbor-bars, and fair white pinions, and lusty wooden walls, and trusty hearts of oak—why, they knew no more about the thing than a london bobby does of angels. and that, i suppose, was why their stuff is called poetry, and the lubberly old wind-jammers poetical. you give me a smart steamboat, mr. onslow; there’s all the romance on her an old sailorman’s got any use for; and he understands it, too, even if he can’t put it down on paper.”
