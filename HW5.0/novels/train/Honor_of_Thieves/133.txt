“that’s not my way, dear. mrs. shelf has been telling me what a very dull young man i am, and suggested that i should commence improving matters by going up and insulting my hostess. i’m afraid i haven’t done it. to begin with, i couldn’t; and to go on with, she’d squash me out of existence with a look, if i made the attempt. you see, amy, i know my limitations; i’m a tolerably heavy person, with limited powers of speech, and a subdued sense of humor.”
