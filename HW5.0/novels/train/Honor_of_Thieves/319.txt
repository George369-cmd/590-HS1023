passing through the lock-gates into the basin, the steamer’s port quarter swung gently towards the wall. a sailor, in readiness, dropped from above and ran aft with the lanyard of a cork fender. the trimmer jumped on the bulwarks, and one might have thought that he was going to bear a hand—an unnecessary hand. the sailor did so, and cursed him for his officiousness. the donkeyman, however, who was oiling the after-winch, had other ideas on the subject, and stood by for a rush. so it befell when that trimmer was getting himself ready for a spring back on the quay-head, the donkeyman’s long legs took him rapidly across the red iron decks, and when the trimmer was already in mid-air, the donkeyman’s huge paw descended upon the slack of his black breeches, and drew him back as though he possessed the weight of a feather pillow. whereat the crowd at the pier-head yelled with delighted laughter, and the dingy steamer made her way stolidly on to the muddy waters of the mersey ebb, which bubbled against the lip of the walls beyond.
