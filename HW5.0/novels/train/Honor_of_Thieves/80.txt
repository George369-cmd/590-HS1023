mr. theodore shelf left the billiard-room with a feeling beneath his waistcoat much akin to sea-sickness. first of all, that plain-spoken patrick onslow had not over politely hinted that he was a canting hypocrite, and had showed cause for arriving at the conclusion. this was true, but that didn’t make it any the more digestive. and secondly, he himself, in a moment of excitement, had let drop to this same pernicious onslow (who after all was a comparative stranger) a proposal to make the sum of £500,000 at one _coup_. true, he had not mentioned the means; but onslow had at once concluded it was to be gained by robbery, and he (theodore shelf) had not denied the impeachment.
