he noticed it, and commented to himself on the circumstance: “that’s excitement, i suppose—excitement pure and understandable. not being a man of stone, i can’t help being thrilled with the majesty of the moment, the sublime vagueness of my knowledge of what will happen when a current flashes through these wires. i’m not a coward. people who write about other men’s feelings when death is beginning to paw them on the shoulder, write mostly from the imagination; and, so far as i’ve seen, they all do it wrong. i’ve been there; i’ve felt the old man’s bony touch more than once; and so i know. a man isn’t of necessity terrified; phantoms of his past deeds do not invariably flash before him; nor does he always lose his nerve, and move like a cheap automaton. i can’t speak for others; but what i personally have felt has been a dull carelessness for what is going to happen, and a curiosity about what will come afterwards. it seems to me that a thinking man, with the ambition of a mouse, should never fear death, because once dead, he becomes wiser than all the living remnant of the human race. there are men, i know, whom physical danger turns into a helpless mass of palpitating nerves. shelf, for instance, is one of those. by jove!”—he smiled grimly—“by jove! i’d give a finger to have theodore shelf in my shoes just now, and force him to couple these wires, and spring the mine with his own fat, white fingers. i believe—yes, i verily believe the experience would turn him honest. ah, there goes one bell. time’s up.”
