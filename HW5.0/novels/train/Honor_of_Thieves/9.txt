amy rivers laughed. “that’s generalizing. but it was different last night, because, so to speak, i’m a member of the household here. a ward counts as a sort of niece, doesn’t she? or between that and an adopted daughter? but, anyway, it was out of sheer pity for mr. onslow in the first instance, and it was with distinct qualms that i let him take me down to dance. i quite intended, after half a round, to say the room was too crowded, and go and sit somewhere. that is to say, i made up my mind to do this when he asked me. however, when i dropped my fingers on his arm to go down-stairs, i had my doubts. you know after two seasons one gets instinctively to know by the first touch how a man will dance. and when he put his arm around me, and we moved to the music, i felt like going on forever. waltzing is hard just now, because it’s in a transition state between two styles; but his dancing was something to dream about. we started off with the newest quick waltz. hamilton, it was just lovely! he was so perfect that just for experiment i altered my step—by degrees, you know. automatically, and without anything being seen, he changed too; and we were dancing the old slow glide before i knew. and his steering was perfect. in that whirling, teeming, tangled mob he never bumped me once. i gave him two more waltzes, and cut another couple in his favor.”
