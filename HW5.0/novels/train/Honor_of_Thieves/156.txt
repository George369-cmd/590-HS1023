 it was late in the evening when patrick onslow again found himself _en tête-à-tête_ with his host. there had been people in to dinner at the house in park lane, but these had gone, and mrs. shelf and amy rivers followed them to lady latchford’s dance. mrs. shelf had wished to carry onslow also in her train, but that person stayed behind by a request which he could not very well refuse. “you will favor me very much by remaining here for the rest of the evening, mr. onslow,” shelf had said in his pompous way. “i have matters of the greatest moment which i wish to discuss with you.”
