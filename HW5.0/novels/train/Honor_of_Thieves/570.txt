“well, first, sor, the captain and meself had a little friendly discussion about what’s been happening, and came to a bit of a financial agreement. but i will say that i figured me new terms very low when i understood it was a thrifle of a conspiracy that ye wanted me to stand in at. and then, sor, we went below to the engine-room and turned steam into the bilge pumps, to heave this nasty slop of water overboard; after which, as chief, i set about making a thrifting repair to the low-pressure engine. ye see, when that explosion took place, a bit of a casting jumped into the crank-pit, and got jammed there hard before they could stop her. i’ve had a fair do at elbow work, cutting it out cold; but it’s clear now, and she runs as sweetly as she did the day she left the shops. but oh, mr. onslow, i wish you could see the old man. the sight of that little chap, shoveling coals, and swearing, and tumbling, and burning himself, is enough to make the ghosts of some dead firemen i know about grin and dance sand-jigs in their graves.”
