fairfax laughed. “why does london society take up with an ex-bushranger from australia, or a glorified advertising cowboy from the wild, wild west? simply because london society is extremely parochial, and gets desperately bored with its own little self undiluted. now, onslow has undoubtedly wandered about outside the parish; and occasionally he lets drop hints which make one think he’s seen some queerish ups and downs in places where polite society doesn’t go; and, in fact, he preserves a good-humored reticence about most of his doings. this makes people thoughtful and speculative. if a chinese extradition warrant was to turn up to-morrow to arrest him for sticking up a three-button mandarin beyond the great wall, nobody would be a bit surprised; or if he were to tell the city this afternoon that he’d a concession for a silver mine in an unexplored part of venezuela which he wished to dispose of at reasonable rates, we’d take it with pleased equanimity. now, you know, amy, there’s a fearful joy in entertaining a man of that stamp.”
