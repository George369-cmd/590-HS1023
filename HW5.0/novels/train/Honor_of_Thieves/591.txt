knot by knot, the brine of the mexican gulf was being left behind, and the noises of the woods and odors of the trees and the swamps were closing in upon them. the swell fanning out from the steamerâ€™s wake wetted the alligators in their basking-places behind the saw-grass; and the reek from her smoke-stacks scared the stilt-legged waterfowl afish in the shallows. she coasted round a bayou of black water, walled in by stern ranks of cypress-trees; she cut across another with graceful-leaved palmetto-scrub on either hand, and ragged cabbage-palms sprouting out from above. and then she swung again where the river forked, and steamed down a straight, unswerving water-line, which led to the very heart of the everglades.
