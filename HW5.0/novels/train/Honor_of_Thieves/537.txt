steamer sailors are not used to small-boat sailing in a heavy sea, and it takes them some time to wear down the novelty of it. by a providence, there was the second mate in one, an old north sea smacksman, to take the tiller, and an able seaman from the same school in the other boat, who was also competent to manage her. the boats were built for the weather, but they required handling; and excepting these two men, there were no others up to the task. the rest trimmed ship, some of them baling, some too frightened to do anything but cling on to a thwart—these last from the fireholds mostly—and with their complements in this danger and disorder, the _port edes’_ two lifeboats drove away into the night and the north-north-east.
