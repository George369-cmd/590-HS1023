“my dear mr. onslow, please give me credit for a little more finesse. i see the objection to intermediate ports as much as you do, but i merely mentioned them to fairfax as a blind. to begin with, it is a hundred to one chance against our getting any cargo at all consigned to them at this season of the year, even if we offered to carry it gratis. in the second place, if it was offered, i could easily get out of it in fifty ways. afterwards, when the deplorable accident takes place, an inquiry into this will help to draw off attention from your floridan peninsula. any one inclined to carp will instantly be told that we were equally ready to put the specie ashore on the virginian coast if our other cargo had led us there. what do you think of that now?”
