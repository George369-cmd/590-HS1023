if only he understood onslow, and, better still, knew whether he might trust him, there was a fortune to be had. yes, a fortune! and it was wanted badly. the great firm of marmaduke rivers and shelf, which called itself “agents to the oceanic steam transport co.,” but which really ran the line of steamers which traded under that flag, might look prosperous to the outer eye, and might still rear its head haughtily amongst the first shipping firms of london port. but the man who bragged aloud that he owned it all, from offices to engine-oil, knew otherwise. he had mortgages out in every direction, mortgages so cunningly hidden that only he himself was aware of their vast total. he knew that the firm was rotten—lock, stock, and barrel. he knew that through any one of twenty channels a breakup might come any day; and, following on the heels of that, a smash, which would be none the pleasanter because, from its size and devastating effects, it would live down into history.
