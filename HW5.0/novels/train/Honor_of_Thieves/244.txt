“no, i don’t. i just gave you my own opinion, as from man to man, just because i respect myself. but i’m not going round to your place of worship to shout it out to them that sit under you. they wouldn’t believe me if i did. not now at any rate. besides, it wouldn’t do me any good, and i couldn’t afford it. i’m a needy man, mr. shelf, as you have guessed; and that’s why i’m going to accept your offer. but don’t let us have any misunderstanding between ourselves as to what it foots up to. what i’m going to sign on for directly, when you hand me the papers, is a spell of piracy on the high seas, neither more nor less. and i’m going to have my money all paid down in advance before i ring an engine-bell on your blasted tramp of a steamer. i guess that’s fair enough. my family’ll want something to go on with if i’m caught, because if one’s found out at this game it’s just a common ordinary hanging matter. yes, sir, swing by the neck till i’m dead as an ax, and may heaven have mercy on _your_ miserable tag of a soul! that’s what this tea-party means, and for your dirty £500 you’re buying a live human man.”
