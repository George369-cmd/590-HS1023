over all was owen kettle, master mariner. whatever his failings might be (and the index of them tailed out), they did not show prominently at the head of such a ship’s company. like all men in the merchant marine, he had been bred in the roughest school; but, unlike his successful brethren, he had not graduated later on to the smooth things of a well-manned passenger liner. for his sins he had remained the pitiful knock-about skipper, a man with knife-edged words always ready on the lip of his teeth, a leaden whistle in one jacket-pocket, and a lethal weapon in the other. he was an excellent seaman and navigator—a man capable of going an entire voyage without taking off his clothes or enjoying one watch of regular sleep. whilst in command at sea, he credited himself with the powers of a czar, and was entirely unscrupulous in gaining ends which expediency or his owners laid down for him; and though not physically powerful, he had the pluck of a dog, and an unholy reputation for marksmanship. taking into allowance these qualifications, it may be understood that for the handling of such a menagerie of all-nation scoundreldom and incapacity as bunked in the s. s. _port edes_, no better man than owen kettle breathed in either hemisphere.
