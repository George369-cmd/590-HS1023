i had risen while uttering these words, carried away by involuntary excitement which i knew to be unwise. m. termonde had bent over the fire again, and once more taken up the tongs. he made no answer to my outburst. had he really felt some slight disturbance, as i believed for an instant, at hearing me speak of that inevitable and dreadful morrow of the grave which fills myself with such fear now that there is blood upon my hands? i could not tell. his profile was, as usual, calm and sad. the restlessness of his hands--recalling to my mind the gesture with which he turned and returned his cane while my mother was telling him of the disappearance of my father--yes, the restlessness of his hands was extreme; but he had been working at the fire with the same feverish eagerness just before. silence had fallen between us suddenly; but how often had the same thing happened? did it ever fail to happen when he and i were in each other's company? and then, what could he have to say against the outburst of my grief and wrath, orphan that i was? guilty, or innocent, it was for him to be silent, and he held his peace. my heart sank; but, at the same time, a senseless rage seized upon me. at that moment i would have given my remaining life for the power of forcing their secret from those shut lips, by any mode of torture.
