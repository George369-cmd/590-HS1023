she came--and with him. she took her seat in the parlour, which is decorated with vile portraits of scholars who have taken prizes at the general examinations. my schoolfellows were also talking to their mothers, but none could boast a mother so worthy to be loved as mine! never had she seemed to me so beautiful, with her slender and elegant figure, her graceful neck, her deep eyes, her fine smile. but i could not say a word to her, because my stepfather, "jack," as she called him, with her pretty affectation of an english accent, was there between us. ah! that antipathy which paralyses all the loving impulses of the heart, how intensely have i felt it, then and since! i thought i could perceive that my mother was surprised, almost saddened by my coldness when she bade me farewell; but ought she not to have known that i would never show my love for her in his presence? she is gone; she is on her travels, and i remain here.
