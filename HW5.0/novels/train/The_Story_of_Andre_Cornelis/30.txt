it would have been natural for me to question my mother; but the truth is, i felt quite unable to repeat to her what my unconscious tormentors had said. it was strange but true, that henceforth my mother, whom nevertheless i loved with all my heart, exercised a paralysing influence over me. she was so beautiful in her pallor, so beautiful and proud. no, i should never have ventured to reveal to her that an irresistible doubt of the story she had told me was implanted in my mind merely by the two questions of my schoolfellows; but, as i could not keep silence entirely and live, i resolved to have recourse to julie, my former nurse. she was a little woman, fifty years of age, an old maid too, with a flat wrinkled face; but her eyes were full of kindness, and indeed so was her whole face, although her lips were drawn in by the loss of her front teeth, and this gave her a witch-like mouth. she had deeply mourned my father in my company, for she had been in his service before his marriage. julie was retained specially on my account, and in addition to her the household consisted of the cook, the man-servant, and the chamber-maid. julie put me to bed and tucked me in, heard me say my prayers, and listened to my little troubles. "oh! the wretches!" she exclaimed, when i opened my heart to her and repeated the words that had agitated me so terribly. "and yet it could not have been hidden from you for ever." then it was that she told me all the truth, there in my little room, speaking very low and bending over me, while i lay sobbing in my bed. she suffered in the telling of that truth as much as i in the hearing of it, and the touch of her dry old hand, with fingers scarred by the needle, fell softly on my curly head.
