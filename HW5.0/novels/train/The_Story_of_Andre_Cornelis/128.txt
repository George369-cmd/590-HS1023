i see you now, and those eyes which revealed your stainless but sorely wounded heart. you come to me, and you pardon me; your hand strokes my check with that sad, sad caress which you gave me before you went away into the darkness, where hands may no more be clasped or tears mingled. if death had not come to you too quickly, if i had obeyed your last desire, you would have carried the secret of your most painful doubts to the grave. you do not blame me now for having wanted to know? you no longer blame me for having suffered? a destiny exists, and weighs upon us, which requires that light shall be cast upon the darkness of that crime, that justice shall resume its rights, and the avenger come. by what road? that power knows, and uses strange weapons for its task of reparation. it was decreed, dear and pious sister of my murdered father, that your faithful cherishing of his dear memory should at last arouse my slumbering will. reproach me not, o tender, unquiet spirit, with the torments which i have inflicted upon myself, with the tragic purpose to which i have sacrificed my youth. rest, i say, rest! may peace descend upon the grave in which you sleep beside my father, in the cemetery at compi√®gne, where i too shall find repose one day. and to think that to-morrow might be that day!
