will you pardon me that falsehood which i told you in your last hours, o my beloved dead? your desire that i should never read those fatal letters, which have begun to shed so terrible a light upon the past, arose from your solicitude to spare me the suspicions that had tortured yourself. on your death-bed your sole thought was for my happiness. will you forgive me for having frustrated that foresight of the dying? i must speak to you, although i know not whether you can see me this day, or hear me, or even feel the emotion which goes out to you, beloved one, from my inmost soul. but, i am ashamed of having lied to you, when you thought only of being good to me, so good, so good that no human creature was ever better to another; and i am forced to tell you this. you, at least, i have never doubted; there is only one touch of bitterness in my thoughts of you; it is that i did not cherish you sufficiently while you were here with me, that i betrayed you in the matter of the last earthly desire of your pure soul.
