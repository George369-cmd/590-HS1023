what are the other images? a large space, with old trees in it, some children playing late on an autumn day; while others, who are not playing, but only look on, lean against the old brown tree-stems, or wander about like forsaken creatures. this is the playground of the lyc√©e at versailles. the scholars who are playing are the "old" boys, the others, the shy exiles, are the "new," and i am one of the latter. it is just four short weeks since my aunt told me of my mother's marriage, and already my life is entirely changed. on my return from the holidays it was decided that i should enter the school as a boarder. my mother and my stepfather were about to travel in italy until the summer, and the question of their taking me with them was not even mooted. my mother proposed to allow me to remain as a day-pupil, under the care of my aunt, who would come up to paris; but my stepfather negatived the proposition at once by quite reasonable arguments. why should so great a sacrifice of all her habits be imposed upon the old lady, and what was there to dread in the rough life of a boarding-school, which is the best means of forming a boy's character?
