dread of her answer made my voice falter; i knelt down before her as i used to do when a child, and, taking both her hands, i covered them with kisses. again, at this solemn hour, my lips were met by that golden wedding-ring which i hated like a living person; yet the feeling did not hinder me from speaking to her almost childishly. "ah," i said, "you have troubles, and to whom should you tell them if not to me? where will you find any one to love you more? be good to me," i went on; "do you not feel how dear you are to me?" she bent her head twice, made a sign that she could not speak, and burst into painful sobs.
