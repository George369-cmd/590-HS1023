"it is a fact that scraps of conscience do remain intact in very depraved individuals. one sees instances of this especially in countries where habits and morals are more genuine and true to nature than ours. there's spain, for instance, the country that interests you so much; when i lived in spain, it was still infested by brigands. one had to make treaties with them in order to cross the sierras in safety; there was no case known in which they broke the contract. the history of celebrated criminal cases swarms with scoundrels who have been excellent friends, devoted sons, and constant lovers. but i am of your opinion, and i think it is best not to count too much upon them."
