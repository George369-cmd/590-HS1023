ah! how bitterly ashamed i am of what i am going to write in this place! i will write it, however, for i have sworn to myself that i will be true, even to the avowal of that fault, even to the avowal of a worse still. i had no difficulty in understanding what was passing in my aunt's mind; the little packet--it had fallen on the carpet close to the fender--evidently contained letters which she wished to destroy, so that i should not read them. she might have burned them, dreading as she did their fatal influence upon me, long since; yet i understood why she had shrunk from doing this, year after year, i, who knew with what idolatry she worshipped the smallest objects that had belonged to my father. had i not seen her put away the blotting-book which he used when he came to compi√®gne, with the paper and envelopes that were in it at his last visit? yes, she had gone on waiting, still waiting, before she could bring herself to part for ever with those dear and dangerous letters, and then her sudden illness came, and with it the terrible thought that these papers would come into my possession. i could also take into account that the unreasonable distrust which she had yielded to of late had prevented her from asking jean or julie for the little coffer. this was the secret--i understood it on the instant--of the poor thing's impatience for my arrival, the secret also of the trouble i had witnessed. and now her strength had betrayed her. she had vainly endeavoured to throw the letters into the fire, that fire which she could hear crackling, without being able to raise her head so as to see the flame. all these notions which presented themselves suddenly to my thoughts took form afterwards; at the moment they melted into pity for the suffering of the helpless creature before me.
