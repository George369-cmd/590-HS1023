 my poor aunt! she thought me made of stronger stuff than i really was. there was no need of her advice to prevent my being consumed by the desire for vengeance which had been the fixed star of my early youth, the blood-coloured beacon aflame in my night. ah! the resolutions of boyhood, the "oaths of hannibal" taken to ourselves, the dream of devoting all our strength to one single and unchanging aim--life sweeps all that away, together with our generous illusions, ardent enthusiasm, and noble hopes. what a difference there is between the boy of fifteen, unhappy indeed, but so bold and proud in 1870, and the young man of eight years later, in 1878! and to think, only to think, that but for chance occurrences, impossible to foresee, i should still be, at this hour, the young man whose portrait hangs upon the wall above the table at which i am writing. of a surety, the visitors to the salon of that year (1878) who looked at this portrait among so many others, had no suspicion that it represented the son of a father who had come to so tragic an end. and i, when i look at that commonplace image of an ordinary parisian, with eyes unlit by any fire or force of will, complexion paled by senseless dissipation, hair cut in the fashion of the day, strictly correct dress and attitude, i am astonished to think that i could have lived as i actually did live at that period. between the misfortunes that saddened my childhood, and those of quite recent date which have finally laid waste my life, the course of my existence was colourless, monotonous, vulgar, just like that of anybody else. i shall merely note the stages of it.
