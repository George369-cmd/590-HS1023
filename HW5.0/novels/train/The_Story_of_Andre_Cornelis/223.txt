i opened an iron safe built into the wall, in which i kept papers which i especially valued, and took out first the letters from my father to my aunt which i had selected and placed on top of the packet. these were the latest in date, and i held them out to him, just as i had arranged them in their envelopes. the letters were addressed to "mademoiselle louise cornélis, compiègne;" they bore the post-mark and the quite legible stamp of the days on which they were posted in the april and may of 1864. it was the former process over again. if m. termonde were guilty, he would be conscious that the sudden change of my attitude towards himself, the boldness of my allusions, the vigour of my attacks were all explained by these letters, and also that i had found the documents among my dead aunt's papers. it was impossible that he should not seek with intense anxiety to ascertain what was contained in those letters that had aroused such suspicions in me? when he had the envelopes in his hands i saw him bend his brows, and i had a momentary hope that i had shattered the mask that hid his true face, that face in which the inner workings of the soul are reflected. the bent brow was, however, merely a contraction of the muscles of the eye, caused by regarding an object closely, and it cleared immediately. he handed me back the letters without any question as to their contents.
