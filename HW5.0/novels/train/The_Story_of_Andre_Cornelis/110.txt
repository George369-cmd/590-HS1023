i began a thorough and searching investigation of all the dead man's papers. with that unbounded tenderness of hers for my stepfather, which made me so miserable, my mother had placed all these papers in m. termonde's keeping. alas! why should she have understood those niceties of feeling on my part, which rendered the fusion of her present with her past so repugnant to me, any more clearly on this point than on any other? m. termonde had at least scrupulously respected the whole of those papers, from plans of association and prospectuses to private letters. among the latter were several from m. termonde himself, which bore testimony to the friendship that had formerly subsisted between my mother's first husband and her second. had i not known this always? why should i suffer from the knowledge? and still there was nothing, no indication whatever to put me on the track of a suspicion.
