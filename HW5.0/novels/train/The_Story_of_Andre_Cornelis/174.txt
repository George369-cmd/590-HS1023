my nervousness gave way to determination at once feverish and fixed--yes, it was both--and it was in a mood of perfect self-mastery, that, after a long period of mental conflict, i repaired to the hotel on the boulevard, with the plan of my discourse clearly laid out. i felt almost sure of finding my stepfather alone; for my mother was to breakfast on that day with madame bernard. m. termonde was at home, and, as i expected, alone in his study. when i entered the room, he was sitting in a low chair, close to the fire, looking chilly, and smoking. like myself in my dark hours, he drugged himself with tobacco. the room was a large one, and both luxurious and ordinary. a handsome bookcase lined one of the walls. its contents were various, ranging from grave works on history and political economy to the lightest novels of the day. a large, flat writing-table, on which every kind of writing-material was carefully arranged, occupied the middle of the room, and was adorned with photographs in leather cases. these were portraits of my mother and m. termonde's father and mother. at least one prominent trait of its owner's character, his scrupulous attention to order and correctness of detail, was revealed by the aspect of my stepfather's study; but this quality, which is common to so many persons of his position in the world, may belong to the most commonplace character as well as to the most refined hypocrite. it was not only in the external order and bearing of his life that my stepfather was impenetrable, none could tell whether profound thoughts were or were not hidden behind his politeness and elegance of manner. i had often reflected on this, at a period when as yet i had no stronger motive for examining into the recesses of the man's character than curiosity, and the impression came to me with extreme intensity at the moment when i entered his presence with a firm resolve to read in the book of his past life.
