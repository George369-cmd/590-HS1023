she had been sent to tell me the truth, but her strength failed her. i escaped from her, ran out into the corridor, and reached my father's bedroom before any one could stop me. ah! upon the bed lay a form covered by a white sheet, upon the pillow a bloodless, motionless face, with fixed, wide-open eyes, for the lids had not been closed; the chin was supported by a bandage, a napkin was bound around the forehead; at the bed's foot knelt a woman, still dressed in her white summer gown, crushed, helpless with grief. these were my father and my mother. i flung myself upon her, and she clasped me passionately, with the piercing cry, "my andre, my andr√©!" in that cry there was much intense grief, in that embrace there was such frenzied tenderness, her heart was then so big, that it warms my own even now to think of it. the next moment she rose and carried me out of the room, that i might see the dreadful sight no more. she did this easily, her terrible excitement had doubled her strength. "god punishes me!" she said over and over again. she had always been given, by fits and starts, to mystical piety. then she covered my face, my neck, and my hair with kisses and tears. may all that we suffered, the dead and i, be forgiven you, poor mother, for the sincerity of those tears at that moment. in my darkest hours, and when the phantom was there, beckoning to me, your grief pleaded with me more strongly than his plaint. because of the kisses of that moment i have always been able to believe in you, for those kisses and tears were not meant to conceal anything. your whole heart revolted against the deed that bereaved me of my father. i swear by the anguish which we shared in that moment, that you had no part in the hideous plot. ah, forgive me, that i have felt the need even now of affirming this. if you only knew how one sometimes hungers and thirsts for certainty--ay, even to the point of agony.
