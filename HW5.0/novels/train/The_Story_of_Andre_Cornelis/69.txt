how i loved that room on the ground floor, with its glass door opening on the garden. it was filled with remembrance for me. on the wall at the side of the old-fashioned "secretary" hung the portraits, in frames of all shapes and sizes, of those whom the good and pious soul had loved and lost. this funereal little corner spoke strongly to my fancy. one of the portraits was a coloured miniature, representing my great-grandmother in the costume of the directory, with a short waist, and her hair dressed _à la_ proudhon. there was also a miniature of my great-uncle, her son. what an amiable, self-important visage was that of the staunch admirer of louis philippe and m. thiers! then came my paternal grandfather, with his strong parvenu physiognomy, and my father at all ages. underneath these works of art was a bookcase, in which i found all my father's school prizes, piously preserved. what a feeling of protection i derived from the portières in green velvet, with long bands of needlework, my aunt's masterpieces, which hung in wide folds over the doors! with what admiration i regarded the faded carpet, with its impossible flowers, which i had so often tried to gather in my babyhood! this was one of the legends of my earliest years, one of those anecdotes which are told of a beloved son, which make him feel that the smallest details of his existence have been observed, understood, and loved. in later days i have been frozen by the ice of indifference. and my aunt, she whose life had been lived among these old-fashioned things, how i loved her, with that face in which i read nothing but supreme tenderness for me, those eyes whose gaze did me good in some mysterious part of my soul! i felt her so near to me, only through her likeness to my father, that i rose from my task four or five times to kiss her, during the time it took me to write my letter of congratulation to the worst enemy i had, to my knowledge, in the world.
