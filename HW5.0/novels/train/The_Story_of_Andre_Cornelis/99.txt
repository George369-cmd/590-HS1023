i once spoke to her of the vow i had taken, the solemn promise i had made to myself that i would discover the murderer of my father, and take vengeance upon him, and she laid her hand upon my mouth. she was a pious woman, and she repeated the words of the gospel: "vengeance is mine, saith the lord." then she added: "we must leave the punishment of the crime to him; his will is hidden from us. remember the divine precept and promise, 'forgive and you shall be forgiven.' never say: 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' ah, no; drive this enmity out of your heart, corn√©lis; yes, even this." and there were tears in her eyes.
