how often, in my dark hours, have i recalled this dialogue, and the room in which it took place--a little salon, much liked by my mother, with hangings and furniture of some foreign stuff striped in red and white, black and yellow, that my father had brought from morocco; and how plainly have i seen my mother in my mind's eyes, with her black hair, brown eyes, and quivering lips. she was as white as the summer gown she wore that evening. m. termonde was dressed with his usual correctness, and i remember well his elegant figure. it makes me smile when people talk of presentiments. i went off perfectly satisfied with what he had said. i had a childish admiration for this man, and hitherto he had represented nothing to me but treats and indulgence. i attended the two classes at the lyc√©e with a relieved heart. but, while i was sitting upon the lower step of my little staircase, all my uneasiness revived. i hammered at the door again, i called as loudly as i could; but no one answered me, until the good woman who had been my nurse came into my room.
