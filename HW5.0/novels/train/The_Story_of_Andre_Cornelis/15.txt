and, since then, no news! in the evening of that day, when dinner, which had been put off for one quarter of an hour after another, was over, and my father, always so methodical, so punctual, had not come in, mother began to betray her uneasiness, and could not conceal from me that his last words dwelt in her mind. it was a rare occurrence for him to speak with misgiving of his undertakings! the night passed, then the next morning and afternoon, and once more it was evening. my mother and i were once more seated at the square table, where the cover laid for my father in front of his empty chair, gave, as it were, form to our nameless dread. my mother had written to m. jacques termonde, and he came--after dinner. i was sent away immediately, but not without my having had time to remark the extraordinary brightness of m. termonde's blue eyes, and usually shone coldly in his thin face. he had fair hair and a light beard. so children take note of small details, which are speedily effaced from their minds, but afterwards reappear, at the contact of life, just as certain invisible marks come out upon paper held to the fire. while begging to be allowed to remain i was mechanically observing the hurried and agitated turning and returning of a light cane--i had long coveted it--held behind his back in his beautiful hands. if i had not admired the cane so much, and the fighting centaurs on its handle--a fine piece of work--this symptom of extreme disturbance might have escaped me. but, how could m. termonde fail to be disturbed by the disappearance of his best friend? nevertheless, his voice, which made all his phrases melodious, was calm.
