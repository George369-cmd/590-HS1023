"would you like to see him?" asked my mother, almost timidly, and as i hesitated she added, under the impression that i was afraid of fatiguing him, whereas i was much surprised by the proposal, "he asked to see you himself; he wants to hear the news from you about yesterday's ballot at the club." was this the real motive of a desire to see me, which i could not but regard as singular, or did he want to prove that our interview had left him wholly unmoved? was i to interpret the message which he had sent me by my mother as an additional sign of the extreme importance that he attached to the details of "society" life, or was he, apprehending my suspicions, forestalling them? or, yet again, was he, too, tortured by the desire to know, by the urgent need of satisfying his curiosity by the sight of my face, whereon he might decipher my thoughts?
