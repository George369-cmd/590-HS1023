 let me remember? i have the sense of having trodden a sorrowing way during many years, but what was my first step in the blood-spotted pathway of pain? where ought i to take up the tale of the slow martyrdom, whose last stage of torture i have reached to-day? i know not, for my feelings are like those lagoon-worn shores on which one cannot tell where sea begins or ends; vague places, sand and water, whose uncertain outline is constantly changing and being formed anew; regions without bounds. nevertheless these places are drawn upon the map, and we may depict our feelings also by reflection, and after the manner of analysis. the reality is ever shifting about. how intangible it is, always escaping our eager grasp! the enigma of enigmas is to know the exact moment at which a wound gapes in the heart, one of those wounds which in mine have never closed. in order to simplify everything, and to keep myself from sinking into that torpor of reverie which steals over me like the influence of opium, i will divide my task into events, marking first the precise fact which was the primal and determining cause of all the rest--the tragic and mysterious death of my father. let me endeavour to recall the emotion by which i was overwhelmed at that time, without mixing with it anything of what i have since understood and felt.
