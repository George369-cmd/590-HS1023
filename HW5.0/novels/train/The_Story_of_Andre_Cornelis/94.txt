"forgetfulness! is this then in all reality the world's law?" i asked myself, with the indignant revolt of a young heart, which does not admit the inevitable compromises of feeling. and i made answer to myself, no! there was one person who remembered as well as i did, one person to whom my father's death still remained a hideous nightmare, one person to whom i could tell all my thoughts and all my grief--my dear, good, kind aunt. in her case at least all the fond and tender things of the past remained unchanged. when august came, and i went to compi√®gne for a portion of my holidays, i found everything in its place, both in the house and in the heart of the dear old maid.
