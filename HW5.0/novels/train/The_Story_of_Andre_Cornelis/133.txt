those letters were not mine, i never ought to have appropriated them. i ought now to destroy them unopened; all the more that the excitement of the first moment, the sudden rush of ideas which had prevented me from obeying the agonised supplication of my poor aunt, had subsided. i asked myself once more what was the cause of her misery, while i gazed at the inscription upon the cover, in my aunt's hand: "1864--justin's letters." the very room which i occupied was an evil counsellor to me in this strife between an indisputable duty and my ardent desire to know; for it had formerly been my father's room, and the furniture had not been changed since his time. the colour of the hangings was faded, that was all. he had warmed himself by a fire which burned upon that self-same hearth, and he had used the same low, wide chair in which i now sat, thinking my sombre thoughts. he had slept in the bed from which i had just risen, he had written at the table on which i rested my arms. no, that room deprived me of free will to act, it made my father too living. it was as though the phantom of the murdered man had come out of his grave to entreat me to keep the oft-sworn vow of vengeance. had these letters offered me no more than one single chance, one against a thousand, of obtaining one single indication of the secrets of my father's private life, i could not have hesitated. with such sacrilegious reasoning as this did i dispel the last scruples of pious respect; but i had no need of arguments for yielding to the desire which increased with every moment.
