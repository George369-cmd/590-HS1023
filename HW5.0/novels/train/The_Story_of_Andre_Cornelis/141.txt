the letters became more and more gloomy, as it always happens when one has not at once put an end to a false position; my father suffered from the consequences of his weakness, and allowed them to develop without taking action, because he could not now have checked them without painful scenes. after having tolerated the increased frequency of his friend's visits, it was torture to him to observe that his wife was sensibly influenced by this encroaching intimacy. he perceived that she took termonde's advice on all the little matters of daily life--upon a question of dress, the purchase of a present, the choice of a book. he came upon the traces of the man in the change of my mother's tastes, in music for instance. when we were alone in the evenings, he liked her to go to the piano and play to him, for hours together, at haphazard; now' she would play nothing but pieces selected by termonde, who had acquired an extensive knowledge of the german masters during his residence abroad. my father, on the contrary, having been brought up in the country with his sister, who was herself taught by a provincial music-master, retained his old-fashioned taste for italian music.
