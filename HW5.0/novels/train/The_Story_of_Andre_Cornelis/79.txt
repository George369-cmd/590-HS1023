that same evening i had the curiosity to refer to the dictionary for this word "muscadin," and i found the following definition: "a young man who studies personal adornment." it is true that i do not resemble the fellows in tunics among whom i am to live, for i am handsomely dressed, according to my mother's taste, and my costume includes a large white collar and smart english boots. the other boys have shapeless képis, coarse blue stockings which fall over their broken shoes, and their buttons are mostly torn off. they wear out the last year's outdoor costume in the house. during the first play-time on my first day, several of the boys eyed me curiously, and one of them asked me: "what does your father do?" i made no answer. what i dread, with unbearable misery, is that they may speak to me of it. yesterday, while my stepfather and i were coming down to versailles in the railway carriage, without exchanging a word, what would i have given to be able to tell him of this dread, to entreat him not to throw me among a number of boys, and leave me to their heedless rudeness and cruelty, to promise him that i would work harder and better than before, if i might but remain at home! but the look in his blue eyes is so sharp when they rest on me, it is so hard for me to say the word "papa" to him--that word which i am always saying in my thoughts to the other; to him who lies, in the sleep that knows no waking, in the cemetery at compiègne! and so i addressed no supplication to m. termonde, and i allowed myself to be shut up in the versailles lycée without a word of protest. i preferred to wander about as i do among strangers, to uttering one complaint to him. mamma is to come to-morrow; she is going away the next day, and the nearness of this interview prevents me from feeling the inevitable separation too keenly. if she will only come without my stepfather!
