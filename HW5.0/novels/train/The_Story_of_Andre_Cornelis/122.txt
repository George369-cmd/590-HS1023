"she is awake," said julie, who had taken the maid's place at the foot of the bed. i approached my aunt and called her by her name. i then clearly saw her poor face distorted by paralysis. she recognised me, and as i bent down to kiss her, she stroked my cheek with her sound hand. this caress, which was habitual with her, she repeated slowly several times. i placed her, with julie's assistance, on her back, so that she could see me distinctly; she looked at me for a long time, and two heavy tears fell from the eyes in which i read boundless tenderness, supreme anguish, and inexpressible pity. i answered them by my own tears, which she dried with the back of her hand; then she strove to speak to me, but could only pronounce an incoherent sentence that struck me to the heart. she saw, by the expression of my face, that i had not understood her, and she made a desperate effort to find words in which to render the thought evidently precise and lucid in her mind. once more she uttered an unintelligible phrase, and began again to make the feeble gesture of despairing helplessness which had so shocked me at her waking. she appeared, however, to take courage when i put the question to her: "what do you want of me, dear aunt?" she made a sign that julie was to leave the room, and no sooner were we alone than her face changed. with my help she was able to slip her hand under her pillow, and withdraw her bunch of keys; then separating one key from the others she imitated the opening of a lock. i immediately remembered her groundless fears of being robbed, and asked her whether she wanted the box to which that key belonged. it was a small key of a kind that is specially made for safety locks. i saw that i had guessed aright; she was able to get out the word "yes," and her eyes brightened.
