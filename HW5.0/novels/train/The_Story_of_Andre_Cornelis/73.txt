 indelible! yes, those two dates and only those have remained so, and when i retrace the past in fancy, i am always stopped by them. the two images--my father assassinated, my mother married again--weighed long upon my heart. other children have restless and supple minds which yield easily to successive impressions; they surrender themselves entirely to the actual moment, pass from a pleasure to a childish trouble, and forget in the evening what they have felt during the day. but i? ah, no! from my two recollections i was never released. an ever present hallucination kept before my mind's eye the dead face on the pillow, and my mother kneeling at the bed's foot, or the sound in my ears of my aunt's voice announcing the other news. i could always see her sad face, her brown eyes, and the black bows on her cap shaking in the wind of the september afternoon. and still, even to-day, when i am endeavouring to reproduce the history of my mind's life, or the real and solitary andré cornélis, all other remembrances vanish before those two; not a phase of my youth but is pervaded by them and contained in them, as the cloud contains the lightning, and the fire it kindles, and the ruins of the homesteads which it strikes. of all the images that crowd upon my memory, recalling what i was during my long years of childhood and youth, those two disastrous days are always the chief; they form the background of the picture of my life, the dark horizon of a more melancholy landscape.
