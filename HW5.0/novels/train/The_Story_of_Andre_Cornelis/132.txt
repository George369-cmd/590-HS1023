at three o'clock in the morning julie came in to take my place, and i retired to my room, which was on the same floor as my aunt's. a box-room divided the two. i threw myself on my bed, worn out with fatigue, and nature triumphed over my grief. i fell into that heavy sleep which follows the expenditure of nerve power, and from which one awakes able to bear life again and to carry the load that seemed unendurable. when i awoke it was day, and the wintry sky was dull and dark like that of yesterday, but it also wore a threatening aspect, from the great masses of black cloud that covered it. i went to the window and looked out for a long time at the gloomy landscape closed in by the edge of the forest. i note these small details in order that i may more faithfully recall my exact impression at the time. in turning away from the window and going towards the fire which the maid had just lighted, my eye fell upon the packet of letters stolen from my aunt. yes, stolen--'tis the word. it was in the place where i had put it last night, on the mantelshelf, with my purse, rings, and cigar-case. i took up the little parcel with a beating heart. i had only to stretch out my hand and those papers would fall into the flames and my aunt's dying wish be accomplished. i sank into an easy-chair and watched the yellow flame gaining on the logs, while i weighed the packet in my hand. i thought there must be a good many letters in it. i suffered from the physical uneasiness of indecision. i am not trying to justify this second failure of my loyalty to my dear aunt, i am trying to understand it.
