 i had reached the second floor. at one corner of the long corridor there was a notification that the numbers ran from 300 to 360. a waiter passed me, whistling; two girls were chattering and laughing in a kind of office at the stair-head; the various noises of the courtyard came up through the open windows. the moment was opportune for the execution of my project. with these people about the man could not hope to escape from the house. 345, 350, 351 353--i stood before the door of edmond termonde's room; the key was in the lock; chance had served my purpose better than i had ventured to hope. this trifling particular bore witness to the security in which the man whom i was about to surprise was living. was he even aware that i existed? i paused a moment before the closed door. i wore a short coat, so as to have my revolver within easy reach in the pocket, and i put my right hand upon it, opened the door with my left, and entered without knocking.
