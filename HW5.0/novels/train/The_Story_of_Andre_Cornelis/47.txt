even now i cannot define the reasons which sent this name to my lips so suddenly, without a moment's thought. no doubt m. termonde had been a good deal at our house since my father's death; but had he not visited us as often, if not more frequently, before my mother's widowhood? had he not managed every detail of our affairs for us with care and fidelity, which even then i could recognise as very rare? why should the news of his marriage with my mother seem to me on the instant to be much worse news than if she had married no matter whom? exactly the opposite effect ought to have been produced, surely? i had known this man for a long time; he had been very kind to me formerly--they said he spoiled me--and he was very kind to me still. my best toys were presents from him, and my prettiest books; a wonderful wooden horse which moved by clockwork, given to me when i was seven--how much my poor father was amused when i told him this horse was "a double thoroughbred"--"don quixote," with dor√©'s illustrations, this very year; in fact some new gift constantly, and yet i was never easy and light-hearted in his presence as i had formerly been. when had this restraint begun? i could not have told that, but i thought he came too often between my mother and me. i was jealous of him, i may as well confess it, with that unconscious jealousy which children feel, and which made me lavish kisses on my mother when he was by, in order to show him that she was my mother, and nothing at all to him. had he discovered my feelings? had they been his own also? however that might be, i now never failed to discern antipathy similar to my own in his looks, notwithstanding his flattering voice and his over-polite ways. to a child instinct is never deceived about such impressions. this was quite enough to account for the shiver that went over me when i uttered his name. but i saw my aunt start at my cry.
