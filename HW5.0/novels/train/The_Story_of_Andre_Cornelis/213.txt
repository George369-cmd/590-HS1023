i had been surprised by my stepfather's having expressed a wish to see me during his illness; but i was far more surprised when, a fortnight later, my servant announced m. termonde in person, at my abode. i was in my study, and occupied in arranging some papers of my father's which i had brought up from compi√®gne. i had passed these two weeks at my poor aunt's house, making a pretext of a final settlement of affairs, but in reality because i needed to reflect at leisure upon the course to be taken with respect to m. termonde, and my reflections had increased my doubts. at my request, my mother had written to me three times, giving me news of the patient, so that i was aware he was now better and able to go out. on my return, the day before, i had selected a time at which i was almost sure not to see any one for my visit to my mother's house. and now, here was my stepfather, who had not been inside my door ten times since i had been installed in an apartment of my own, paying me a visit without the loss of an hour. my mother, he said, had sent him with a message to me. she had lent me two numbers of a review, and she now wanted them back as she was sending the yearly volume to be bound; so, as he was passing the door, he had stepped in to ask me for them. i examined him closely while he was giving this simple explanation of his visit, without being able to decide whether the pretext did or did not conceal his real motive. his complexion was more sallow than usual, the look in his eyes was more glittering, he handled his hat nervously.
