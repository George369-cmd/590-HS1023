i had had the room on the ground floor, next to the salon, prepared for my mother. i remembered that she had occupied it, when she came to compi√®gne with my father, a few days after her marriage, and i felt sure that the impression which would be produced upon her by the sight of the house in the first instance, and then by the sight of this room, would help me to get rid of my dreadful suspicions. i was determined to note minutely the slightest signs of agitation which she might betray at the contact of a resuscitated past, rendered more striking by the aspect of things that do not change so quickly as the heart of a woman. and now, i blushed for that idea, worthy of a detective; for i felt it a shameful thing to judge one's mother: one ought to make an act of faith in her which would resist any evidence. i felt this, alas! all the more, because the innocent woman was quite off her guard, as was perfectly natural. she entered the room with a thoughtful look, seated herself before the fire, and held her slender feet towards the flames, which touched her pale cheeks with red; and, with her jet black hair, her elegant figure, which still retained its youthful grace, she shed upon the dim twilight of the old-fashioned room that refined and aristocratic charm of which my father spoke in his letters. she looked slowly all around her, recognising most of the things which my aunt's pious care had preserved in their former place, and said, sorrowfully: "what recollections!" but there was no bitterness in the emotion depicted on her face. ah! no; a woman who is brought, after twenty years, into the room which she had occupied, as a bride, with the husband whose murder she has contrived after having betrayed him, has not such eyes, such a brow, such a mouth as hers.
