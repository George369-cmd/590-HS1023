we have become sceptics and misanthropes. we play at despairing atheism just as parizelle and rocquain play at debauchery, gervais and others at sport and fashion, politics and love. old sorbelle, having been dismissed from the lyc√©e, has just published a pamphlet in which he figures under the name of lebros, and the provost under that of m. bifteck. this little book occupies our attention throughout the whole winter, and induces us to form a conspiracy which leads to nothing. here we are, then, playing at revolution! what a strange discipline is that of those infamous schools, where young boys ruin their years of unhappy youth by the puerile and premature imitation of passions from which they will have to suffer in reality some day, just as children, who are destined to die in war as men, play at soldiers, with their flaxen curls and their ringing laughter! alas! for me the game was over too soon.
