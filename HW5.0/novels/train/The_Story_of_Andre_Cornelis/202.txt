three days passed. i was suffering tortures of irresolution, mingled with incoherent projects no sooner formed than they were rejected as impracticable. to know?--this was easily said, but i, who was so eager, nervous, and excitable, so little able to restrain my quickly-varying emotions, would never be able to extort his secret from so resolute a man, one so completely master of himself as my stepfather. my consciousness of his strength and my weakness made me dread his presence as much as i desired it. i was like a novice in arms who was about to fight a duel with a very skilful adversary; he desires to defend himself and to be victorious, but he is doubtful of his own coolness. what was i to do now, when i had struck a first blow and it had not been decisive? if our interview had really told upon his conscience, how was i to proceed to the redoubling of the first effect, to the final reduction of that proud spirit? my reflections had arrived and stopped at this point, i was forming and re-forming plans only to abandon them, when a note reached me from my mother, complaining; that i had not gone to her house since the day on which i had missed seeing her, and telling me that my stepfather had been very ill indeed two days previously with his customary liver complaint. two days previously, that was on the day after my conversation with him. here again it might be said that fate was making sport of me, redoubling the ambiguity of the signs, the chief cause of my despair. was the imminence of this attack explanatory of the agonised expression of my stepfather's face when he passed me in his carriage? was it a cause, or merely the effect of the terror by which he had been assailed, if he was guilty, under his mask of indifference, while i flung my menacing words in his face? oh, how intolerable was this uncertainty, and my mother increased it, when i went to her, by her first words.
