and now i found proof in my father's letters that a divorce of the heart already existed between the two persons who, to my filial tenderness, were but one. my father loved his wife passionately, and he felt that his wife did not love him. this was the feeling continually expressed in his letters--not in words so plain and positive, indeed; but how should i, whose boyhood had been strangely analogous with this drama of a man's life, have failed to perceive the secret signification of all he wrote? my father was taciturn, like me--even more so than i--and he allowed irreparable misunderstandings to grow up between my mother and himself. like me afterwards, he was passionate, awkward, hopelessly timid in the presence of that proud, aristocratic woman, so different from him, the self-made man of almost peasant origin, who had risen to professional prosperity by the force of his genius. like me--ah! not more than i--he had known the torture of false positions, which cannot be explained except by words that one will never have courage to utter. and, oh, the pity of it, that destiny should thus repeat itself; the same tendencies of the mind developing themselves in the son after they had developed themselves in the father, so that the misery of both should be identical!
