my mother belonged, by her own family, to a totally different sphere of society from that into which her marriage with my father had introduced her. at first she did not feel any regret for her former circle, because her extreme beauty secured her a triumphant success in the new one; but it was quite another thing when her intimacy with termonde, who moved in the most worldly and elegant of parisian "worlds," was perpetually reminding her of all its pleasures and habits. my father saw that she was bored and weary while doing the honours of her own salon with an absent mind. he even found the political opinions of his friend echoed by his wife, who laughed at him for what she called his utopian liberalism. her mockery had no malice in it; but still it was mockery, and behind it was termonde, always termonde. nevertheless, he said nothing, and the shyness, which he had always felt in my mother's presence, increased with his jealousy. the more unhappy he was, the more incapable of expressing his pain he became. there are minds so constituted that suffering paralyses them into inaction. and then there was the ever-present question, what was he to do? how was he to approach an explanation, when he had no positive accusation to bring? he remained perfectly convinced of the fidelity of his wife, and he again and again affirmed this, entreating my aunt not to withdraw a particle of her esteem from his dear marie, and imploring her never to make an allusion to the sufferings of which he was ashamed, before their innocent cause. and then he dwelt upon his own faults; he accused himself of lack of tenderness, of failing to win love, and would draw pictures of his sorrowful home, in a few words, with heart-rending humility.
