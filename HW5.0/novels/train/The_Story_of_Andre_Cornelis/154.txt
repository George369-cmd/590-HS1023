julie's face made one among the many things which recalled her first marriage to my mother's mind; and, either because the almost sudden death of my aunt had deeply moved her, or because this sentimental recurrence to the past was an indulgence of her taste for the romantic, far from avoiding such recollections, she yielded to them fully, while i silently blessed her for thus destroying the last vestiges of my mute calumny. how fervent was my mental thanksgiving, when, later in the night, she asked to see my dear dead aunt, so that she might take a last farewell of her! we entered the room where the dying woman had striven with the last earthly solicitude from which i had drawn such black conclusions. death had strengthened the resemblance that existed in her lifetime between my aunt and my father. the motionless face forcibly recalled that other face still living in my sad memory, and in whose presence my mother had clasped me in so warm an embrace; and the resemblance was made more striking by the chin-cloth which kept the mouth closed. once more we stood side by side before a funereal spectacle; but i was no longer a child, and my mother was no longer a young woman.
