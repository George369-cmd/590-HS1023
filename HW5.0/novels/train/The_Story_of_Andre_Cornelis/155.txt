how many years lay between those two deaths--and what years! the comparison struck my mother too; she did not speak for a while--then she whispered: "how like him she is!" she bent over the bed, pressed a kiss on the ice-cold brow, and kneeling at the foot of the bed, she prayed. this trying ordeal, of which i had hardly ventured to dream, she herself had sought in so natural, so simple a way. . . . since then i have had many other tokens of the absolute blamelessness of my mother, i have heard words uttered by him who had contrived and arranged the whole crime, which fully exonerated the noble woman; but there was no need of them. the sight of her kneeling beside the dead sister of my dear father had sufficed to exorcise the phantom.
