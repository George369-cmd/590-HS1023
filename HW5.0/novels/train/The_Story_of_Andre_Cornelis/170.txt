i fell at once from my fancied height as an imaginary grand justiciary into the shallows of parisian frivolity. i was about to hear chatter upon the last play, the latest suit for separation, the latest love affairs, and the newest bonnet. it was for this that i had eaten my heart out all these days! the servant preceded me to the hall i knew so well, with its oriental divan, its green plants, its strange furniture, its slightly faded carpet, its meissonier on a draped easel, in the place formerly occupied by my father's portrait, its crowd of ornamental trifles, and the wide-spreading japanese parasol open in the middle of the ceiling. the walls were hung with large pieces of chinese stuff embroidered in black and white silk. my mother was half-reclining in an american rocking-chair, and shading her face from the fire with a hand-screen; madame bernard, who sat opposite to her, was holding her muff with one hand and gesticulating with the other; m. termonde, in walking-dress, was standing with his back to the chimney, smoking a cigar, and warming the sole of one of his boots. on my appearance, my mother uttered a little cry of glad surprise, and rose to welcome me. madame bernard instantly assumed the air with which a well-bred woman prepares to condole with a person of her acquaintance upon a bereavement. all these little details i perceived in a moment, and also the shrug of m. termonde's shoulders, the quick flutter of his eyelids, the rapidly dismissed expression of disagreeable surprise which my sudden appearance called forth. but what then? was it not the same with myself? i could have sworn that at the same moment he experienced sensations exactly similar to those which were catching me at the chest and by the throat. what did this prove but that a current of antipathy existed between him and me? was it a reason for the man's being a murderer? he was simply my stepfather, and a stepfather who did not like his stepson. . . .
