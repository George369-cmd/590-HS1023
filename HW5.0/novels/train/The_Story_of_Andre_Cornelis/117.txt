 my good old julie was waiting for me at the station. her eyes had failed her of late, for she was seventy years old, nevertheless she recognised me as i stepped out of the train, and began to talk to me in her usual interminable fashion so soon as we were seated in the hired coupé, which my aunt had sent to meet me whenever i came to compiègne, from the days of my earliest childhood. how well i knew the heavy old vehicle, with its worn cushions of yellow leather, and the driver, who had been in the service of the livery stable keeper as long as i could remember. he was a little man with a merry roguish face, and eyes twinkling with fun; but he tried to give a melancholy tone to his salutation that morning.
