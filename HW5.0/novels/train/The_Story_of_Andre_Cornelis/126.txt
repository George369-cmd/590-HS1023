she raised her eyes, full of eager supplication, i closed the lids with my lips and stooped to pick up the little packet. on the paper in which it was folded, i distinctly read this date: "1864--justin's letters." 1864! that was the last year of my father's life. i know it, i feel it, that which i did was infamous; the last wishes of the dying are sacred. i ought pot, no, i ought not to have deceived her who was on the point of leaving me for ever. i heard her breathing quicken at that very moment. then came a whirlwind of thought too strong for me. if my aunt louise was so wildly, passionately eager that those letters should be burned, it was because they could put me on the right track of vengeance. letters written in the last year of my father's life, and she had never spoken of them to me! i did not reason, i did not hesitate, in a lightning-flash i perceived the possibility of learning--what? i knew not; but--of learning. instead of throwing the packet of letters into the fire, i flung it to one side, under a chair, returned to the bedside and told her in a voice which i endeavoured to keep steady and calm, that her directions had been obeyed, that the letters were burning. she took my hand and kissed it. oh, what a stab that gentle caress inflicted upon me! i knelt down by her bedside, and hid my head in the sheets, so that her eyes should not meet mine. alas! it was not for long that i had to dread her glance. at ten she fell asleep, but at noon her restlessness recurred. at two the priest came, and administered the last sacraments to her. she had a second stroke towards evening, never recovered consciousness, and died in the night.
