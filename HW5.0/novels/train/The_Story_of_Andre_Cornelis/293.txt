other objections presented themselves. if my stepfather had employed his brother to commit the murder, how came he to reveal the existence of that brother to his wife? an answer to this question was not far to seek. if the crime had been committed under conditions of complicity, only one proof of the fact could remain, namely, the letters written by jacques termonde to edmond, in which the former recalled the latter to europe and gave him instructions for his journey; these letters edmond had of course preserved, and it was through them, and by the threat of showing them to my mother, that he kept a hold over his brother. to tell his wife so much as he had told her was to forestall and neutralise this threat, at least to a certain extent; for, if the doer of the deed should ever resolve on revealing the common secret to the victim's widow, now the wife of him who had inspired it, the latter would be able to deny the authenticity of the letters, to plead the former confidence reposed in her respecting his brother, and to point out that the denunciation was an atrocious act of revenge achieved by a forgery. and, besides, if indeed the crime had been committed in the manner that i imagined, was not that revelation to my mother justified by another reason?
