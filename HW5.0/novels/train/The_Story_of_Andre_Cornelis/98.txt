that abstention from any kind of struggle with me was a fixed resolution on his part, i guessed, because i knew him to be very determined by nature, and especially incapable of enduring that any one should brave him. he was fond of relating how, in his youth, when he was attached to the embassy at madrid, he had killed a bull at an amateur "ring," on being "dared" to do it by a young spaniard. it must have hurt his pride severely to permit me the silent insolence of my eyes; he did allow me to indulge it, however, and i did not acknowledge that petty triumph to aunt louise. i must set down everything here, and the truth is i was most unhappy; i knew myself to be so, and i did not lessen my trouble in the least in dilating upon it; on the contrary, i rather exaggerated it so as to win that tender sympathy which did my sore heart good.
