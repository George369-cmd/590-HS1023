 how could i have talked of all these small things to a lady who dined with the duchesse d'arcole, whose intimate friends were a maréchale and two marquises, and whose entertainments were described in the society journals? my mother was now the beautiful madame termonde, and so completely had her new name replaced the old, that i was almost the only person who remembered she was also the widow of m. cornélis, he whose tragical death had been related in the very same newspapers. had she herself forgotten it?
