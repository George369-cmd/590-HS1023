i should not have been the sullen and resentful boy i then was, if i had not planned how to utilise my strange power of disturbing the man whom i execrated, in the interest of my enmity. my system was to force him to feel the acute sensation which my presence inflicted on him, by keeping silence, and steadily pursuing him with my gaze. great as his self-control was, i never fixed my eyes upon him from the far end of the room, but, after a while, he would turn his eyes towards me. then his glance avoided mine, and he would go on talking; but still he was looking at me, and presently our eyes would meet, and his would shift away again. i knew, by a frown which gathered on his forehead, that he was on the point of forbidding me to look at him in that way; but then he would put strong restraint upon himself, and sometimes he would leave the room.
