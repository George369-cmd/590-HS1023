"he has not forgotten you," i answered. in this i lied; for m. massol had never spoken of my stepfather to me; but that frenzy which had made me attack him almost madly in the conversation of the other evening had seized upon me again. should i never find the vulnerable spot in that dark soul for which i was always looking? this time his eyes did not falter, and whatever there was of the enigmatical in what i had said, did not lead him to question me farther. on the contrary, he put his finger on his lips. used as he was to all the sounds of the house, he had heard a step approaching, and knew it was my mother's. did i deceive myself, or was there an entreaty that i would respect the unsuspecting security of an innocent woman in the gesture by which he enjoined silence? was i to translate the look that accompanied the sign into: "do not awaken suspicion in your mother's mind, she would suffer too much;" and was his motive merely the solicitude of a man who desires to save his wife from the revival of a sad remembrance? she came in; with the same glance she saw us both, lighted by the same ray from the lamp, and she gave us a smile, meant for both of us in common, and fraught with the same tenderness for each. it had been the dream of her life that we should be together thus, and both of us with her, and, as she had told me at compi√®gne, she imputed the obstacles which had hindered the realisation of her dream to my moody disposition. she came towards us, smiling, and carrying a silver tray with a glass of vichy water upon it; this she held out to my stepfather, who drank the water eagerly, and, returning the glass to her, kissed her hand.
