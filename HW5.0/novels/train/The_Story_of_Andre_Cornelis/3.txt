on these sheets of paper i will draw a true picture of my destiny, for i can catch only glimpses of it in the blurred mirror of my thoughts. and when the pages are covered with my scrawl i will burn them. but the thing will have taken form, and existed before my eyes, like a living being. i shall have thrown a light upon the chaos of horrible recollections which bewilder me. i shall know what my strength really is. here, in this room where i came to the final resolution, it is only too easy for me to remember. to work, then! i pass my word to myself that i will set down the whole.
