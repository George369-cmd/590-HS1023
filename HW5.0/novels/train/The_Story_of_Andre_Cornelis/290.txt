"i must be cool," i repeated, "i must be cool;" and i put all my strength to recalling the physical and moral particulars respecting the crime which were in my possession. it was my business now to try whether one single point remained obscure when tested by the theory of the identity of rochdale with edmond termonde. the witnesses were agreed in representing rochdale as tall and stout, my mother had described edmond termonde as a big, heavy man. fifteen years lay between the assassin of 1864 and the elderly rake of 1879; but nothing prevented the two from being identical. my mother had dwelt upon the colour of edmond termonde's eyes, pale blue like those of his brother; the concierge of the imperial hotel had mentioned the pale blue colour and the brightness of rochdale's eyes in his deposition, which i knew by heart. he had noticed this peculiarity on account of the contrast of the eyes with the man's bronzed complexion. edmond termonde had taken refuge in america after his alleged suicide, and what had m. massol said? i could hear him repeat, with his well-modulated voice, and methodical movement of the hand: "a foreigner, american or english, or, perhaps, a frenchman settled in america." physical impossibility there existed none. and moral impossibility? that was equally absent. in order to convince myself more fully of this, i took up the history of the crime from the moment at which my father's correspondence concerning jacques termonde became explicit, that is to say, in january, 1864.
