i evoked the image of my father as he lived, just as i had seen him for the last time; i heard him replying to m. termonde's question in the dining-room of the rue tronchet, and speaking of the man who awaited him to kill him: "a singular man whom i shall not be sorry to observe more closely." and then he had gone out and was walking towards his death while i was playing in the little salon, and my mother was talking to the friend who was one day to be her master and mine. what a happy home-picture, while in that hotel room---- ah! was i never to find the key of the terrible enigma? where was i to go? what was i to do? at what door was i to knock?
