"_it is so sad to feel that one is in the way in one's own house, that one possesses a woman by every right, that she gives one all that her duty obliges her to give, all, except her heart, which is another's, unknown to herself, perhaps, unless, indeed, that---- my sister, there are terrible hours in which i say to myself that i am a fool, a coward, that he is her lover, she is his mistress, that they laugh together at me, at my blindness, my stupid trust. do not scold me, dear louise. this idea is infamous, and i drive it away by taking refuge with you, to whom, at least, i am all the world._"
