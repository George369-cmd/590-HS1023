the exceptional character of this fresh hypothesis was too evident for me to yield to it immediately; indeed, the first time the idea occurred to me, i ridiculed myself mercilessly. i remembered my childish terror and the many proofs i had had of my readiness and ingenuity in confounding the imaginary with the real. how like my former self i still was, how incapable of chasing away the phantoms which suddenly appeared before me! in vain did i urge this upon myself, because it was no more than an improbability that the false rochdale should be bribed by m. termonde to murder my father; it was not an absolute impossibility. the least reflection shows that in the matter of crime everything happens. i then set to work to recall all the extraordinary stories of the cour d'assises which i could remember. my imagination turned blood-colour, like the horizon where the sun was setting. i reentered the house, i dined, as i had breakfasted, all alone, and then i passed the evening in the salon, silting where my mother had sat. so afraid was i of thought that i asked julie to rejoin me after her supper. the old woman settled herself on a low breton chair, in a corner of the hearth, and went on with her knitting. her needles flashed as they moved in and out amid the brown wool of which she was fabricating a stocking, and her spectacles gleamed in the firelight. sometimes she worked on the whole evening without uttering a word, with boule-de-poil, her favourite, purring at her feet, and pierrot, who was of a jealous disposition, rubbing his head against her, and standing on his hind paws. at other times she talked, answering my questions about my aunt. she repeated what i already knew so well; the solicitude of the dear old woman for me, her dread of possible danger to me, her terrible anxiety on her death-bed. she dwelt upon my aunt's inconsolable regret for my mother's second marriage, and her unconquerable dislike to m. termonde.
