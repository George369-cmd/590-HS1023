there were two alternatives: either he would arrange a meeting in some lonely place, or he would go himself to edmond termonde's abode. in the latter case, i should have the information i wanted at once; in the former, it would be sufficient to give the description of edmond termonde just as i had received it from my mother, and to have him also followed on his return from the place of meeting. the spy-system has always seemed to me to be infamous, and even at that moment i felt all the ignominy of setting this trap for my stepfather; but when one is fighting, one must use the weapons that will avail. to attain my end, i would have trodden everything under foot except my mother's grief. and then? supposing myself in possession of the false name of edmond termonde and his address, what was i to do? i could not, in imitation of the police, lay my hand upon him and his papers, and get off with profuse excuses for the action when the search was finished. i remember to have turned over twenty plans in my mind, all more or less ingenious, and rejected them all in succession, concluding by again fixing my mind on the bare facts.
