then the former judge of instruction gave me some singular examples of the resentment cherished against medical experts employed in legal cases, procureurs of the republic, and presidents of assize. his theory was, that in the course of his practice at the bar my father might have excited resentment of a fierce and implacable kind; for he had won many suits of importance, and no doubt had made enemies of those against whom he employed his great powers. supposing one of those persons, being ruined by the result, had attributed that ruin to my father, there would be an explanation of all the apparatus of this deadly vengeance. m. massol begged me to observe that the assassin, whether he were a foreigner or not, was known in paris. why, if this were not so, should the man have so carefully avoided being seen in the street? he had been traced out during his first stay in paris, when he bought the wig and the beard, and that time he put up at a small hotel in the rue d'aboukir under the name of rochdale, and invariably went out in a cab. "observe also," said the judge, "that he kept his room on the day before the murder, and on the morning of the actual day. he breakfasted in his apartment, having breakfasted and dined there the day before. but, when he was in london, and when he lived at the hotel to which your father addressed his first letters, he came and went without any precautions."
