how simple those few words were, and yet they caught my heart and gripped it as a hand might do. how had i longed for some of those little words which she had never uttered, some of those gracious phrases which are like the gestures of the mind, some of her involuntary tender caresses. now i had what i had so earnestly desired, but at what a moment and by what means! it was, nevertheless, very sweet to feel that she loved me. i told her so, employing words which scorched my lips, so that i might be kind to her.
