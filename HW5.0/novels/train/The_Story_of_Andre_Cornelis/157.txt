she told me--but this i already knew--how her marriage was brought about. she met my father at a ball given by a great lawyer, who was intimate with her family; their name was de slane. she described her own dress at this ball, and then sketched my father for me, in his black coat, with an ill-tied white cravat and ill-fitting gloves. "a young girl is always so foolish," she said. "he had himself introduced to us, and he proposed for me twice over. i refused him each time, just because i had those ill-fitting gloves in my mind. the third time he asked to see me in private. mamma wished very much for the marriage, notwithstanding certain differences in station and education. your father was such a good man, so clever and hard-working, and then he adored my mother with frank simplicity, just as if she were an idol. well, she consented to the interview. i received your father with the firm intention of saying 'no' to him, and he spoke to me so nicely, with so much eloquence and such perfect tact, i saw so plainly how much he loved me, that i said 'yes.' . . . ."
