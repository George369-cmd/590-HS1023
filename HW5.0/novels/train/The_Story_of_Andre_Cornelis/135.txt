presently julie came to consult me upon all the material details which accompany death; but i told her i was too much overwhelmed, that she must do as she thought fit, and leave me quite alone for the whole of the morning. then i plunged so deeply into the reading of the letters, that i forgot the hour, the events taking place around me, forgot to dress myself, to eat, even to go and look upon her whom i had lost while yet i could behold her face. traitor and ingrate that i was! i had devoured only a few lines before i understood only too well why she had been desirous to prevent me from drinking the poison which entered with each sentence into my heart, as it had entered into hers. terrible, terrible letters! now it was as though the phantom had spoken, and a hidden drama of which i had never dreamed unfolded itself before me.
