in the second half of 1870 the franco-prussian war takes place. the invasion finds me at compi√®gne, where i am passing my holidays with my aunt. my stepfather and my mother remain in paris during the siege. i go on with my studies under the tuition of an old priest belonging to the little town, who prepared my father for his first communion. in the autumn of 1871 i return to versailles; in august, 1873, i take my bachelor's degree, and then i do my one year's voluntary service in the army at angers under the easiest possible conditions. my colonel was the father of my old schoolfellow, rocquain. in 1874 i am set free from tutelage by my stepfather's advice. this was the moment at which my task was to have been begun, the time appointed with my own soul; yet, four years afterwards, in 1878, not only was the vengeance that had been the tragic romance, and, so to speak, the religion of my childhood, unfulfilled, but i did not trouble myself about it.
