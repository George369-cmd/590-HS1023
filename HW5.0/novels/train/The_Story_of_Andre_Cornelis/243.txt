 at the beginning of the summer, six months after my aunt's death, i was in exactly the same position with respect to my stepfather as on that already distant day when, maddened with suspicion by my father's letters, i entered his study, to play the part of the physician who examines a man's body, searching with his finger for the tender spot that is probably a symptom of a hidden abscess. i was full of intuitions now, just as i was at the moment when he passed me in his carriage with his terrible face, but i did not grasp a single certainty. would i have persisted in a struggle in which i felt beforehand that i must be beaten? i cannot tell; for, when i no longer expected any solution to the problem set before me for my grief, a grief, too, that was both sterile and mortal, a day came on which i had a conversation with my mother so startling and appalling that to this hour my heart stands still when i think of it. i have spoken of never-to-be-forgotten dates; among them is the 25th of may, 1879.
