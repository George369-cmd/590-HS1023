# 590-HS1023
## Hi, this is George Sun, whose NETID is hs1023.
### This is my 1st assignment including 3 .py files. 
#### The first one named hw1.1-linear is used to build and test the linear regression model, which takes age as x and predicts weight as y.
#### The second one named hw1.1-Logistic1 is aimed to build and test the logistic regression model, which takes age as x and predicts weight as y.
#### The third one named hw1.1-Logistic2 is aimed to build and test the logistic regression model, which takes weight as x and predicts whether the person is adult or child.
### Thanks for reviewing my work!
